Of course, the two are both entertainers and extremely wealthy. But that if you look past the occupational similarities, you'd find that both have a charisma that is magnetic. Prior to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the toxic workplace allegations that have ended her show</a>, Ellen was seen as the type of person who could sit and talk to anyone. And regardless of whatever did or didn't happen on the set of her show, there's no doubt that Ellen has the gift of gab. The same is true for Brad. Whether they are approachable or not, the two sure seem to be able to convince the world that they are. But Brad and Ellen have something else in common.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Aside from their personality traits and their jobs, Brad Pitt and Ellen DeGeneres have something else in common...something that is downright odd. At least, it makes Hollywood seem like a much smaller place. While the two haven't revealed the exact details, it seems as though they have an ex-girlfriend in common. Here's what we know.</p><h2 id=ellen-degeneres-dated-brad-pitt-39-s-ex-girlfriend>Ellen DeGeneres Dated Brad Pitt's Ex-Girlfriend</h2><p>During one of his many appearances on Ellen's daytime talk show, Brad Pitt learned that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the two share a romantic interest in common</a>. The revelation came out during a discussion about how the two first met. Ellen claimed the two met in the late 1980s/early 1990s and Brad elaborated...</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“I remember a Melissa Etheridge pool party, where I think you were hitting on my girlfriend," Brad Pitt said.</p><p>"Was I hitting on your girlfriend, really?" Ellen laughed.</p><p>"I think so. I was flattered."</p><p>"Alright. I actually, since then, have dated another one of your girlfriends," Ellen stated, causing the audience to laugh. "We’ll talk about that later."</p><p>"After the show," Brad said, seemingly already knowing what the audience clearly did not.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Ellen DeGeneres’s Ex Girlfriend Anne Heche Spills All The Gossip</a></span></p><h2 id=who-did-both-ellen-and-brad-date>Who Did Both Ellen And Brad Date?</h2><p>The truth is, we don't know the identity of the woman who dated both Brad Pitt and Ellen DeGeneres. However, given the fact that both of their love lives seem to be public knowledge, fans have taken guesses. While fans would love it to be <a href=#>Jennifer Aniston who has an exceptionally close friendship with Ellen</a>, it's likely not. Jennifer has never stated that she is attracted to both men and women. However, there are a few of Brad's exes who have.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>What Happened To Brad Pitt's Net Worth After His Divorce From Jennifer Aniston?</a></span></p><p>Fans and journalists at YourTango broke down the most likely women who could have been romantically involved with both Ellen and Brad. First off is Robin Givens, who also had a fling with radio legend <a href=#>Howard Stern</a>. In 1986 and 1987, Brad was romantically involved with Robin. While Robin hasn't revealed her sexual orientation beyond being straight, she could have been the woman that Ellen was flirting with at the pool party. Names like Jullitee Lewis and Gwyneth Paltrow have also been floated around but there's really nothing to support either claim. And nobody is saying anything about Angelina Jolie, so she appears to have no chance at being the woman who briefly captured both Brad and Ellen's hearts.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>A more likely candidate would be Westworld's Thandie Newton, who famously made comments about everyone being bisexual. Brad dated Thandie from 1994 to 1995. However, fans at Jezebel pointed out that Ellen and Thandie have basically had no contact. Although given that this is secret, there still could be a chance.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Angelina Jolie And Brad Pitt's 6 Kids: What We Know About Their Estimated Net Worth</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The same goes for Christina Applegate who also dated Brad Pitt. Fans at Paper believe it was Christina who dated both Ellen and Brad due to the fact that she fits Ellen's type to a T. If you look at the majority of the women that Ellen has been with, Portia De Rossi and Anne Heche included, they are almost entirely bombshell blondes. Well, no one fits that mold quite as well as the Married With Children star. According to the LA Times, there are also rumors that Christina is bisexual and according to fans on the internet, she may have actually been briefly married to a woman in Las Vegas. However, there's no evidence to confirm that rumor.</p><p>At any rate, it almost doesn't really matter who Ellen and Brad both dated. While it's natural for fans to want to know, it's not really any of their business unless that woman wants to make it known. The more interesting thing at play here is the odd and somewhat unlikely connection that Brad and Ellen share.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>Duchess Meghan Markle Faces Major Social Media Backlash After Ellen DeGeneres Interview</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGicpaSVo3qlscaepZ6qlah6pa3TnptmmqKWsW68yK2rZp2oYrSqvsufqaKdnpl6s7vMmqWtoZNitaq%2F06ipsmWimrmiwMiopaygmaV6rbvVnmSloZaafA%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fellen-degeneres-dated-brad-pitt-ex-girlfriend-romantic-history-relationship-love-life.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fellen-degeneres-dated-brad-pitt-ex-girlfriend-romantic-history-relationship-love-life.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fellen-degeneres-dated-brad-pitt-ex-girlfriend-romantic-history-relationship-love-life.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fellen-degeneres-dated-brad-pitt-ex-girlfriend-romantic-history-relationship-love-life.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fellen-degeneres-dated-brad-pitt-ex-girlfriend-romantic-history-relationship-love-life.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fellen-degeneres-dated-brad-pitt-ex-girlfriend-romantic-history-relationship-love-life.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./vybz-kartel-council-appeal-2024-1234772479.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./vybz-kartel-council-appeal-2024-1234772479.html>Vybz Kartel's Privy Council Appeal Date Set For 2024</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./kid-capri-scott-storch-2023-bet-hip-hop-1234800783.html>Kid Capri, Scott Storch And More Honored At 2023 BET Hip Hop Awards</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./kid-capri-scott-storch-2023-bet-hip-hop-1234800783.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
