At the age of 24, the pop star,&nbsp;once known for being one of the members of the girl band Fifth Harmony, leads a lavish life where she earns and spends millions. Its story is somewhat similar to <a href=#>the boy band One Direction</a> and was formed at the reality show X-Factor USA. Soon after, Camila decided to go solo, and <a href=#>the success that followed was magnanimous</a>.</p><p>The singer was born in Cuba in 1997. However, she had to keep shifting from Mexico City to Havana along with her family. This could have inspired the composition of one of her hits, 'Havana.' Later, she grew up to become a famous American singer and songwriter, with millions of fans globally. According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Celebrity Net Worth</a>, today, the young singer has a brilliant net worth of $14 million. Here is an account of how the 24-year-old pop star earns and spends her millions.</p><h2 id=earns-fifth-harmony-days>Earns: Fifth harmony Days</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The Fifth Harmony was formed on the stage of The X Factor USA when the talented artists Ally Brooke, Normani, Lauren Jauregui, Dinah Jane, and Camila Cabello, came together as a girl band. Soon after, they were offered a music deal with Syco Music and Epic Records- Simon Cowell's music label, as stated by <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Seventeen</a>.</p><p>The debut album by the band was called 'Reflection,' and it was released in 2015. It ranked fifth in America, number 8 in New Zealand and Canada, and number 9 in Spain. Their single 'Worth It' is one of the most popular. It was ranked 12th in the USA and number 3 in the U.K. The successes were consecutive, and Camila, among other Fifth harmony members, earned some fancy bucks.</p><p>'Work From Home' also became a major hit and sold over 1.4 million digital copies in America alone. <a href=#>Camila had an extremely prosperous career</a> with the Fifth harmony and is known to have sold over half a million albums. In 2016 the pop star decided that she was finally ready to go solo.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=spends-on-a-luxury-estate-in-hollywood-hills>Spends: on a Luxury Estate in Hollywood Hills</h2><p>Camila is reported to be the owner of a luxury mansion in Hollywood Hills in Los Angeles, California.

The five singers also endorsed a deal with Candie, a junior clothing brand under Kohls. This venture became promotional both for the brand and the band as they started appearing more frequently on social media promotions and videos that went viral.</p><p>The collaboration between Kohl and Fifth Harmony proved to be quite lucrative, where Kohl earned an extra 100,000 followers, as stated by <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Heavy</a>. The partnership with Kohl was beneficial in increasing Fifth Harmony's popularity as artists like <a href=#>Britney Spears</a> and Destiny's Child had partnered with this prestigious brand before.</p><h2 id=spends-philanthropy>Spends: Philanthropy</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The pop star became insanely rich at a very young age and ensured her money is put to good use.

She became the first one to hold the number 1 position in the Adult Top 40 and the Mainstream Top 40 lists at the same time. She even became a Grammy nominee for Best Pop Solo Performance and Best Pop Vocal Album. Cabello's performance in the song 'Senorita' alongside Shawn Mendes became a huge sensation and hit the number 1 on the U.S. Billboard 100.</p><p>Camila Cabello is truly a role model for having made such a fantastic career in the music industry at 24.
