<time>28 Aug 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p><strong>Celebrity weddings, whether successful or unsuccessful, are frequently the focus of media attention. However, Daniel’s standing as Kim Zuleika-ex-husband Biermann’s from The Real Housewives of Atlanta raises the standard.</strong></p><p><strong>In addition to Daniel’s brief marriage to Kim and rumors of infidelity, Toce is well-known for being a sex offender who tormented a child. He was found guilty of child rape and given a ten-year prison term for having inappropriate sexual contact with his third wife, Mary’s daughter, who was a minor at the time.</strong></p><p>In addition to his marriage to reality TV star Kim Zuleika, Daniel also experienced a tumultuous divorce from two other women. While Zuleika’s marriage to Daniel Toce has raised a lot of interest in their relationship and problematic marriage, it’s sad for her. The previous couple had a child together, a daughter.</p><h2><span id=What_is_the_Net_Worth_of_Daniel_Toce_Salary_Earnings>What is the Net Worth of Daniel Toce? Salary, Earnings</span></h2><p>While little is known about Daniel Toce’s whereabouts or career, it is questionable how much money he has. However, as of December 2022, other media say that&nbsp;Toce may have a net worth of a six-figure number, i.e. $1 million.</p><p>Daniel’s TV star ex-wife Kim Zolciak, on the other hand, has a<strong> $3 million net worth as of mid-2021.</strong> She made the most of her money by appearing on Bravo’s reality show The Real Housewives of Atlanta, which she joined in 2008 and left in 2018, having starred in 106 episodes.</p><h2><span id=Where_was_Daniel_Toce_born_Ethnicity_Nationality_Family_Education>Where was Daniel Toce born?

He grew up in Waterford, Connecticut, with his family. On the other hand, he is 48 years old and has kept much of his personal information to himself, including his parents.</p><p>Daniel is an American with Caucasian ancestry when it comes to nationality. Daniel is the son of a corporate billionaire, according to sources, but little else is known about his parents. Toce is a high school graduate who, in the middle of such a remarkable early life, is hardly known.</p><h2><span id=Is_Daniel_Toce_Single_Relationship>Is Daniel Toce Single?

He married for the third time following his divorce from Zolciak (his second wife); his charms seemed to work, but the relationship terminated in the end. Toce was married for seven years to Mary, his third wife, and they are now divorced.</p><p>According to Connecticut (CT) police, he was involved and found guilty in the terrible incident of having an unlawful relationship with Mary’s daughter from a previous marriage and even making her pregnant at the age of 15 years.</p><p>The daughter was 16 years old at the time of her arrest, and she was still engaged in similar crimes with her stepfather, who, according to her, used to beat and torture her while she was inebriated with cocaine and other substances.</p><p>According to Kim’s divorce documents, the former couple, Daniel and Kim, married on May 5, 2001. The two walked down the aisle in Destiny, Florida, surrounded by their family and friends.</p><p>In the interim, a number of other tabloids stated that they married on <strong>September 24, 2001</strong>. Toce’s biological daughter, Ariana Biermann, was born on October 17, 2001, to him and his ex-wife Biermann.</p><h2><span id=How_did_Daniel_Toce_start_his_Professional_Career>How did Daniel Toce start his Professional Career?</span></h2><p>Throughout these years, his professional career has remained a mystery, and no information regarding his whereabouts has been published. Since his release from prison in 2021, Kim’s ex-husband has remained grounded. As a result, all information concerning his current activities is kept under wraps. He may or may not be employed at the moment. He hasn’t had any touch with Kim and their daughter Ariana in a long time as a father figure.</p><p><strong>Also Read: <a class=waffle-rich-text-link href=#>Is Eddie Huang Married, Dating, And Engaged</a></strong></p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag>Celebrity</a></span> <a href=#></a><h3 class=small-font><a href=#>Philip Pearsall Carpenter</a></h3>Philip Pearsall Carpenter estimated Net Worth, Biography, Age, Height, Dating, Relationship Records, Salary, Income, Cars, Lifestyles & many more details have been updated below.
