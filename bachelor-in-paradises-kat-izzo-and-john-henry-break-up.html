<time>13 Jun 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p>Another couple from <a href=#>Bachelor in Paradise season 9</a> have called it quits just days after the <a href=#>finale</a> aired.</p><p><strong>Kat Izzo</strong> and <strong>John Henry Spurlock</strong> announced their breakup on Monday, December 11, with a joint Instagram post.</p><p>“With mutual love and respect, Kat and I have recently decided to part ways. Our relationship has been filled with wonderful memories and growth, something we looked forward to sharing with you. While our paths are taking different directions due to our career goals not aligning, we are grateful for the love and support we’ve received from our family, friends, and Bachelor Nation,” the statement read. “While this decision wasn’t easy, we believe it’s the right step for both of us as individuals. As we navigate this transition, we ask for your continued support and respect for our privacy.”</p><p>Bachelor Nation watched John Henry, 31, <a href=#>propose</a> to Kat, 27, on the Thursday, December 7, finale of the ABC series despite concerns that they were moving too quickly.</p><p>“I’ve always, kind of, trusted my gut and I feel like in life that it’s helped me at times. Right now, my gut is telling me that it’s too soon — a lot of what ifs, is this real. But right now, I’m gonna try something a little different and follow my heart today,” he said before getting down on one knee. “My heart’s telling me that you are amazing, you are what I’m looking for. I really do see a future with you and I’m not falling in love, I am in love with you too. That being said, Kat, will you marry me?”</p><p>In her pre-proposal speech to John Henry, Kat noted that she “never felt so comfortable so quickly with a person in my entire life.”</p><p>“And I definitely spent some time doubting myself and seeing this as too good to be true and waiting for something bad to happen because how could something so good come so easy,” she continued. “It’s because of you that I’m standing here right now, happy and incredibly at peace. I am fully and wholeheartedly in love with you.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/%E2%80%98Bachelor-in-Paradise-Season-9-Finale-Kat-Izzo-and-John-Henry-Spurlock-Are-Engaged-2.jpg><p>Fans met Kat on season 27 of The Bachelor, which starred <strong>Zach Shallcross</strong>. Prior to sparking a connection with John Henry, she was <a href=#>linked to <strong>Brayden Bowers </strong></a>and<strong> Tanner Courtad.</strong> John Henry, who appeared on <strong>Charity Lawson</strong>‘s season 20 of The Bachelorette, was seeing <strong>Olivia Lewis</strong> when he opted to pursue things with Kat.</p><p>“I was just really intrigued by him and felt a weird attraction. We had become friends over the few days he was on the beach, so I wasn’t talking to him because I wanted to date him at first,” Kat said of John Henry on the “Bachelor Happy Hour” podcast last month. “He was just really fun to talk to and hang out with, and he’s really easy on the eyes.”</p><p>She added that she never “wanted to disrespect” Olivia.</p><p>“It’s kind of hard in Paradise because we’re all around each other. I know there were multiple times when I wasn’t sure if I wanted to be doing something because I know she still liked him and I would never want to disrespect somebody,” she said. “I was just a little worried on how that was going to be based on what I had seen thus far.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Bachelor-in-Paradise-s-Kat-Izzo-and-John-Henry-Split-Call-Off-Engagement-064.jpg><p>Kat and John Henry were among <a href=#>only three couples</a> still together at the end of Thursday’s finale. <strong>Eliza Isichei </strong>and<strong> Aaron Bryant</strong><a href=#> also got engaged</a>, but they had “hit some speed bumps since they left the beach,” according to the finale. The twosome have yet to give a further update on their romance.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p><strong>Aven Jones </strong>and<strong> Kylee Russell</strong> opted not to get engaged and gushed about their romance after the episode aired. One day later, however, Kylee confirmed they were over and accused <a href=#>Aven of “multiple infidelities.”</a> He <a href=#>apologized</a> in a statement on Sunday, December 10.</p><p>“After careful thought and consideration into writing this, I want to first and foremost apologize to Kylee, my family and my friends for my actions,” Aven wrote. “I have made major mistakes in the relationship and hurt someone who was very close to me. At this time, I am in an extremely, extremely low place trying to work on myself. I am doing my best to find healing, find myself and be a better person. Please have grace and respect for Kylee and her family through this difficult time.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaJmam5iaubC%2BjKKlZqiRp66ltdKeqmajkal6qsbZqGSappRit7C0zWafnqairnqjvsSaomatoGQ%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fbachelor-in-paradises-kat-izzo-and-john-henry-break-up.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fbachelor-in-paradises-kat-izzo-and-john-henry-break-up.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fbachelor-in-paradises-kat-izzo-and-john-henry-break-up.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fbachelor-in-paradises-kat-izzo-and-john-henry-break-up.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fbachelor-in-paradises-kat-izzo-and-john-henry-break-up.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fbachelor-in-paradises-kat-izzo-and-john-henry-break-up.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./jennifer-jason-leigh.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./jennifer-jason-leigh.html>Jennifer Jason Leigh</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./16-iconic-movie-stars-who-were-completely-broke-when-they-died.html>16 Iconic Movie Stars Who Were Completely Broke When They Died</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./16-iconic-movie-stars-who-were-completely-broke-when-they-died.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
