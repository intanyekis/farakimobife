In 1997, he decided to stop drinking for the first time after working with <a href=#>his longtime best friend, Matt Damon</a> on Good Will Hunting. He went to rehab for the first time in 2001, which would begin his many trips there. But his most prominent stints were in 2017 and 2018 following his split from <strong><a href=#>Jennifer Garner</a></strong> in 2015, after 10 years of marriage.</p><p>Back then, the Pearl Harbor star had a two-month fling with 22-year-old Playboy model, Shauna Sexton – who was blamed for his relapses. Later on, a source revealed that the two-time Oscar winner's "always up and down" moods "scarred" his ex when they were together. Sexton also held Affleck – who's reportedly <a href=#>having marriage issues</a> with <strong><a href=#>Jennifer Lopez</a></strong> – accountable for his bad decisions via social media.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/your-paragraph-text-2024-02-28t152959-519.png> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="Even Howard Stern Gasped At The Offer Ben Stiller Turned Down From Matt Damon And Ben Affleck Because Of One Condition ">Even Howard Stern Gasped At The Offer Ben Stiller Turned Down From Matt Damon And Ben Affleck Because Of One Condition</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>Howard Stern didn't hide his expression after Ben Stiller revealed the major film he passed on.</p><h2 id=ben-affleck-allegedly-had-a-party-lifestyle-while-dating-shauna-sexton>Ben Affleck Allegedly Had A Party Lifestyle While Dating Shauna Sexton</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/shauna-sexton-and-ben-affleck-1.jpg><p>In an Us Weekly exclusive in December 2018, a source revealed that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Affleck "really scarred" Sexton</a> because of his "always up and down" moods. "Sometimes he [wanted] to go out, drink and get girls, and other times [he was] completely sober and going to church," said the insider. The Batman actor broke up with the model in October 2018, days after completing his rehab treatment.</p><p>When Affleck first stopped drinking in 1997, he admitted to "regretting some things [he] did when [he] was drunk. He explained: "It's funny to be obnoxious or out of control, but then it’' like, 'I think I hurt that person's feelings,' 'I made a fool of myself' or 'I didn't want to kiss that girl.'"</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"I have almost no inhibitions, so it's dangerous for me," Affleck said of alcohol's effect on him.</p><p>In March 2017, The Accountant star said there's "no shame" in seeking help for alcoholism via Facebook: "I have completed treatment for alcohol addiction; something I've dealt with in the past and will continue to confront. I want to live life to the fullest and be the best father I can be. I want my kids to know there is no shame in getting help when you need it, and to be a source of strength for anyone out there who needs help but is afraid to take the first step."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>He added that he was "lucky to have the love of my family and friends, including my co-parent, Jen [Garner], who has supported me and cared for our kids as I've done the work I set out to do. This was the first of many steps being taken towards a positive recovery." Obviously, his progress didn't continue the following year, for which Sexton was heavily criticized.</p><p>Ben Affleck admitted that his "drinking... created more marital problems" between him and Jennifer Garner.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/fans-understood-the-true-meaning-behind-amy-poehler-s-_harsh_-matt-damon-joke-at-the-golden-globes-front-deposit-back-jimmy-kimmel-live_youtube.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title='Ben Affleck Backed Up Amy Poehler&#39;s "Harsh" Matt Damon Joke At The Golden Globes '>Ben Affleck Backed Up Amy Poehler's "Harsh" Matt Damon Joke At The Golden Globes</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>Ben Affleck confirmed that Amy Poehler calling Matt Damon a "garbage person" had some truth in it.</p><h2 id=ben-affleck-39-s-sober-counselor-advised-him-to-break-up-with-shauna-sexton>Ben Affleck's Sober Counselor Advised Him To Break Up With Shauna Sexton</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/ben-affleck-and-shauna-sexton.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In October 2018, Page Six published an article called, "Why Ben Affleck's Shauna Sexton fling was bad for his health — and his image," which <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">further vilified Sexton online</a>. The outlet cited ET reporting that "Garner and Affleck's sober counselors urged him to cut ties with Sexton." A source added: "He has a lot of money and right now he's still young enough that he needs to get his s**t together. One day he will drink too much and something bad will happen."</p><p>But Sexton's photographer friend, Martin Murillo, said that Affleck's relapse made things difficult for the model, who is not the "attention-loving" person Page Six itself described. "Now that this whole thing has happened, it's gotten harder," said Murillo. "If I’m talking to an agent from LA Models, the first thing they [note] is that she's dating Ben ­Affleck."</p><p>"It could be a good thing, but I think they see it as, 'Oh, here's just another model wanting attention.'"</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>He added that the paparazzi frenzy caused Sexton to quit her day job as a technician at Veterinary Specialty and Emergency Center of Thousand Oaks, California. "I know it was affecting the people at her work so she decided to leave," Sexton's friend said of her life post-Affleck.</p><p>Here are all the women the Argo star dated after his divorce from Garner:</p><table border=1 cellpadding=1 cellspacing=1 align summary><tbody><tr><td><p>2017-2019</p></td><td><p><strong><a href=#>Saturday Night Live</a></strong> producer Lindsay Shookus, on and off; they broke up due to "hectic schedules"</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>2018</p></td><td><p>Shauna Sexton who's more than two decades his junior</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>2020-2021</p></td><td><p>Ana de Armas whom he met on the set of Deep Water; they broke up because "he would not commit to having more kids"</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>2021-present</p></td><td><p>Jennifer Lopez whom he married in 2022 after calling off their engagement in 2004</p></td></tr></tbody></table><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/did-ben-affleck-s-ex-cause-the-destruction-of-his-friendship-with-kevin-smith-1.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="Why Kevin Smith Blamed Jennifer Garner For Destroying His Friendship With Ben Affleck">Why Kevin Smith Blamed Jennifer Garner For Destroying His Friendship With Ben Affleck</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>Ben Affleck and Kevin Smith were the best of friends, until his marriage to Jennifer Garner got in the way.</p><h2 id=shauna-sexton-39-s-past-drinking-related-arrest-was-blamed-on-ben-affleck-39-s-rehab-stint>Shauna Sexton's Past Drinking-Related Arrest Was Blamed On Ben Affleck's Rehab Stint</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In October 2018, another Page Six source called Sexton a bad influence on Affleck. "At the end of the day, in order to be in recovery, [Affleck] needs to be by himself and taking care of his family," they stated. "He's being used by this girl. Anyone who drinks the way she drinks and is out there publicizing it and their relationship, has no respect for him or his family."</p><p>The fitness trainer "has been arrested for underage drinking and public intoxication, and has bragged on social media about her love of drinking and party­ing," per the publication. But Sexton defended herself, telling Instagram commenters that she loves "to drink and party! Absolutely dude," before dragging Affleck.</p><p>"Do these mistakes mean I would disrespect someone's hard earned sobriety by drinking with them or in front of them? Hell no," she said. "I have limitless respect for those who take action and actually do something about it."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"With that being said, Ben is a grown ass man, baby. He makes his own decisions. Blaming a 22-year-old for someone's 3rd time in rehab is just ridiculous..."</p><p>She then reminded fans not to jump to conclusions. "He is human. I am human. You are human. We all are going to f–k up, it's just a matter of learning from it," Sexton wrote. "Don't be so quick to throw shade on people. Take a step back, accept that we are all on our own..."</p><p>Ben Affleck reportedly cheated on Lindsay Shookus with a rehab employee in 2017.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiZnqZdlrOnuMScoqxlkZmxqq%2FToqanZaOYrrO%2BxJ1koaGjYn9zediemKtln6GxbrHXZp6iqpybv6qxzZ1krKCRqruiedKer62nnmQ%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fben-afflecks-addiction-scarred-his-22-year-old-ex-girlfriend-shauna-sexton.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fben-afflecks-addiction-scarred-his-22-year-old-ex-girlfriend-shauna-sexton.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fben-afflecks-addiction-scarred-his-22-year-old-ex-girlfriend-shauna-sexton.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fben-afflecks-addiction-scarred-his-22-year-old-ex-girlfriend-shauna-sexton.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fben-afflecks-addiction-scarred-his-22-year-old-ex-girlfriend-shauna-sexton.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fben-afflecks-addiction-scarred-his-22-year-old-ex-girlfriend-shauna-sexton.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./beyonce-makeup-free-throwback-pic.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./beyonce-makeup-free-throwback-pic.html>Beyonce Is Makeup Free In Throwback Pic With Kelly Rowland &amp;amp; La La Anthony Hollywood Life</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./beautiful-fans-overjoyed-jermall-emotionally-jermell-charlo-canelo-alvarez.html>'This is beautiful' - Fans overjoyed as Jermell Charlo emotionally reunites with estranged twin brot</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./beautiful-fans-overjoyed-jermall-emotionally-jermell-charlo-canelo-alvarez.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
