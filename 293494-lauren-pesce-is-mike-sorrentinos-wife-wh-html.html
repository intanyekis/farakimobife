Although not much is known about the reality star's wife, some personal information is available to the public. Get to know Pesce and her love story with Sorrentino.</p><p class=dh>Lauren Pesce is known as Mike ‘The Situation' Sorrentino's wife. However, there is more to the actor's college sweetheart than meets the eye.</p><p class=dh>Pesce recently revealed on social media that she is expecting her second child with Sorrentino, joining their 14-month-old son, Romeo Reign.</p><p class=dh>The couple is undoubtedly over the moon to become <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://people.com/parents/mike-sorrentino-and-wife-lauren-pregnant-expecting-second-baby/>second-time parents</a>. Pesce, who will endure labor yet again, will undoubtedly be a fantastic mom to her unborn child. What do we know about her?</p><p class=dh><strong class=bh>WHO IS LAUREN PESCE?</strong></p><p class=dh>Born on January 10, 1985, in Holmdel, New Jersey, Pesce was born to Larry and Mary Pesce. She was the middle child of three daughters and had a religious and affluent <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.distractify.com/p/lauren-sorrentino-parents>upbringing</a>. She, along with her family, attended Sunday church weekly.</p><p class=dh>Pesce graduated from Brookdale Community College in Holmdel and Laboratory Institute of Merchandising (LIM) College in New York City, where she graduated with a BA in Fashion Merchandising. After her studies, Pesce continued to work in the same industry until landing a job at Elle, Chanel, and Bergdorf Goodman as an intern.</p><p class=dh>She later had a Saks Fifth Avenue and Macy's buyer position. Her passion for <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.thethings.com/mike-sorrentino-the-situation-wife-lauren-pesce/>fashion</a> transformed into a means to express her thoughts, so she later launched a blog called The Style Bae. The blog became an avenue for her to share personal accounts and opinions, including fashion, beauty, fitness, food, and more.</p><h3 class=ih><strong class=bh>A blessing came a few years after. On May 26, 2021, the couple welcomed their firstborn, a son named Romeo Reign, weighing six pounds and eight ounces.</strong></h3><p class=dh>Beyond her career in the fashion industry, Pesce is also in real estate and found success working for VRI Homes in Monmouth County, New Jersey.</p><p class=dh><strong class=bh>LAUREN PESCE AND MIKE SORRENTINO'S UPS AND DOWNS</strong></p><p class=dh>Pesce and Sorrentino are college sweethearts who had their first date over an Italian dinner and a DVD movie. They took a break between 2009 and 2012, or "however long 'Jersey Shore' was," Pesce <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/pictures/mike-sorrentino-and-lauren-sorrentino-a-timeline-of-their-relationship/2013-2-21/>described</a> in an interview.</p><p class=dh>Around 2013, the pair got back together. "Timing is everything," Pesce <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/pictures/mike-sorrentino-and-lauren-sorrentino-a-timeline-of-their-relationship/april-2018-22/>said</a>. "We circled back to each other [...], and we kind of picked back up where we left off."</p><h3 class=ih><strong class=bh>A year after their wedding, Pesce and Sorrentino revealed that they had a miscarriage two months after the "Jersey Shore" alum served his eight-month prison sentence.</strong></h3><p class=dh>It wasn't until 2018 that Sorrentino proposed before the "Jersey Shore: Family Vacation" cameras filmed them. "I approached the executive producers, and I let them know, 'Listen, I really want to do this. This show is really special to me. This is the show that introduced me to the world,'" he <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/pictures/mike-sorrentino-and-lauren-sorrentino-a-timeline-of-their-relationship/august-2018-28/>said</a>.</p><p class=dh>Although already engaged, their relationship did not go without challenges. Later that year, the reality star had to call his girlfriend to reveal an awkward situation – his friends allowed a naked woman into their hotel room. For the most part, Pesce did not take it lightly. She <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=http://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/pictures/mike-sorrentino-and-lauren-sorrentino-a-timeline-of-their-relationship/august-2018-28/>told</a> him:</p><p class=dh>"That's disgusting. I'm looking at flowers for our wedding, and you're telling me it was thotchella of naked girls in the hotel room? It's time to come home and, like, plan the wedding. We'll talk about that when you get home. It's ridiculous."</p><p class=dh>On November 1, 2018, Pesce and <a class="me a" href=#>Mike Sorrentino</a> exchanged their wedding vows at The Legacy Castle in Pompton Plains, New Jersey. Their family, friends, and the groom's co-stars all witnessed the ceremony. "We are so incredibly excited to begin our journey as husband and wife," the couple <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=http://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/pictures/mike-sorrentino-and-lauren-sorrentino-a-timeline-of-their-relationship/august-2018-28/>said</a>.</p><p class=dh>More than anything else, the newlywed couple was focused on starting a family. Sorrentino, at that time, was facing a possible prison sentence. He later pled guilty to a tax evasion charge. Sorrentino and his brother were indicted due to tax evasion and falsifying records.</p><p class=dh><strong class=bh>LAUREN PESCE IS THE MOTHER OF ROMEO REIGN SORRENTINO</strong></p><p class=dh>A year after their wedding, Pesce and Sorrentino revealed that they had a miscarriage two months after the "Jersey Shore" alum served his eight-month prison sentence. Pesce <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/pictures/mike-sorrentino-and-lauren-sorrentino-a-timeline-of-their-relationship/2009-to-2012-2/>said</a>, as per Us Weekly:</p><p class=dh>"The night he came home, we actually conceived, and then at about six and [a] half, seven weeks, I miscarried. When I found out we were pregnant, I felt like this is why we went through all these challenges for years."</p><p class=dh>She went on to talk about how the experience was challenging for them. However, a blessing came a few years after. On May 26, 2021, the couple welcomed their firstborn, a son named Romeo Reign, weighing six pounds and eight ounces.</p><p class=dh>Romeo quickly became the center of their lives with a Vanessa Antonelli-designed nursery to make him feel comfortable at home. "Throughout our whole pregnancy, Mike was super involved and attentive," the doting mother <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://people.com/parents/mike-the-situation-sorrentino-celebrates-son-romeo-first-birthday/>said</a>. The couple is now happily expecting another addition to their family.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimlazAb63MqKSapZFjsLC5jmtwbGxpaXqtrdSrnKdloJrApLGMoqpmpZmgsm6%2Fzqupnqaknruwv4ywoJ%2BdXay1b7TTpqM%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2f293494-lauren-pesce-is-mike-sorrentinos-wife-wh-html.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2f293494-lauren-pesce-is-mike-sorrentinos-wife-wh-html.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2f293494-lauren-pesce-is-mike-sorrentinos-wife-wh-html.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2f293494-lauren-pesce-is-mike-sorrentinos-wife-wh-html.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2f293494-lauren-pesce-is-mike-sorrentinos-wife-wh-html.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2f293494-lauren-pesce-is-mike-sorrentinos-wife-wh-html.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./lilah-pate.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./lilah-pate.html>Lilah Pate</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./chevy-chase-kids-4992129.html>Everything To Know About The Stars 4 Children Hollywood Life</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./chevy-chase-kids-4992129.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
