On the other hand, some things always seem to remain the case. For example, <a href=#>new celebrity romantic pairings pop up every year</a> and even though some stars remain married for a long time, <a href=#>stars breaking up is a yearly tradition</a> as well.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>These Are The Longest-Lasting Celebrity Marriages</a></span></p><p>Since it is no secret that a lot of stars struggle to find love, it is always worth celebrating when a beloved celebrity seems to find their mate. Fortunately for Kristin Chenoweth, it seems like she has found the right person for her since it has been announced that the extremely talented actor is engaged. With that in mind, it begs a couple of obvious questions, who is Chenoweth’s fiancé, and what is he worth?</p><h2 id=why-is-kristin-chenoweth-rsquo-s-famous-and-what-is-her-dating-history>Why Is Kristin Chenoweth’s Famous And What Is Her Dating History?</h2><p>Among people who only know actors for their film and television roles, Kristin Chenoweth has long been known for her supporting roles. After all, Chenoweth has shown off her impressive acting and singing skills in a long list of films and TV shows even though she has rarely been cast in leading roles. On top of that, Chenoweth has also stood out for a long time as one of <a href=#>the shortest female stars in Hollywood</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Even though Kristin Chenoweth has been great in many of her film and television roles, her onscreen work only hints at her true greatness. After all, Chenoweth has starred in so many plays over the years that she is widely considered to be one of the greatest Broadway legends of all time. As a result of everything that Chenoweth has accomplished during her legendary career, she has earned a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.</p><p>Given the fact that Kristin Chenoweth has been in the spotlight for many, many years at this point, millions of her fans have followed her personal life for a long time. For example, it has become well known that Chenoweth and pop superstar Ariana Grande have become close friends despite the sizable age difference between them. Of course, more attention is paid to Chenoweth’s romantic past than her friendship circle.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Kristin Chenoweth Spills The Beans About Double Dates With Ariana Grande</a></span></p><p>Over the years, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Kristin Chenoweth has been involved with several men</a> that most people wouldn’t recognize by name. However, before Chenoweth got involved with the man she is set to marry in the future, she was romantically linked to several notable names. For example, in the past Chenoweth dated Aaron Sorkin, Seth Green, and Sean Hayes among others. Of course, it now seems like all of those relationships were just dress rehearsals for the man she seems to be destined for.</p><h2 id=how-kristin-chenoweth-met-her-fianc-eacute-josh-bryant-and-how-much-money-is-he-worth>How Kristin Chenoweth Met Her Fiancé Josh Bryant And How Much Money Is He Worth?</h2><p>In October of 2021, it was announced that Kristin Chenoweth had become engaged to someone named Josh Bryant. As it turns out, Chenoweth and Bryant first met at her niece’s wedding in 2016 and then reconnected two years later when they both were at the event where nephew was married. With that in mind, some people may assume that Bryant had a personal connection to Chenoweth’s family before they became a couple. In reality, however, Bryant is a member of a band called Backroad Anthem and they happened to perform at both weddings.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Fans Defend Gwen Stefani From Trolls For Not Inviting 'No Doubt' Band To Her Weddin</a></span></p><p>After Josh Bryant and Kristin Chenoweth’s second meeting, they quickly became a couple and Bryant popped the big question three years later. After announcing the news of their engagement in late-2021, Chenoweth and Bryant spoke to People. During their People interview, it was revealed that Bryant proposed with a De Beers Forevermark by Rahaminov three-stone Halo ring on the rooftop of New York City's Rainbow Room.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Additionally, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Kristin Chenoweth revealed how excited she was to walk down the aisle with Josh Bryant</a> during the aforementioned People interview. "I've been the runaway bride. Now that I've found him, I won't let him go. I will race to greet him at the altar." For his part, Bryant explained what getting engaged to Chenoweth meant to him. “My best friend and soulmate said ‘YES’ to me! Kristin is my world, my everything, and I can’t wait to spend the rest of my life with her!”</p><p>While Josh Bryant is now best known for being engaged to Kristin Chenoweth, he has been in the entertainment business for many years at this point. After all, Bryant has been performing with his country music band Backroad Anthem for a long time at this point. While Backroad Anthem certainly isn’t world-famous by any means, the band has clearly enjoyed success. After all, The Sun reports that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Bryant is worth $600,000</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>Kirstin Chenoweth Admits To Doing This Sneaky Thing</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoaddnsBut9Giqq2hnmKwqbHNqK6erJhir7DFxaugnqaUYrOqusCcnGain6i1bq7RspinrF2jsrV51qipraBf</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwho-is-kristin-chenoweth-boyfriend-finace-josh-bryant-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fwho-is-kristin-chenoweth-boyfriend-finace-josh-bryant-net-worth.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fwho-is-kristin-chenoweth-boyfriend-finace-josh-bryant-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fwho-is-kristin-chenoweth-boyfriend-finace-josh-bryant-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwho-is-kristin-chenoweth-boyfriend-finace-josh-bryant-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwho-is-kristin-chenoweth-boyfriend-finace-josh-bryant-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./what-is-tom-sturridge-sexuality-is-he-gay-details-about-the-sandman-actor-371463-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./what-is-tom-sturridge-sexuality-is-he-gay-details-about-the-sandman-actor-371463-html.html>What Is Tom Sturridge Sexuality Is He Gay?
