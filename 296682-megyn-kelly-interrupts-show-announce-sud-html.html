However, it quickly stopped being about looks for the journalist because she revealed that Brunt seemed sincere and attentive. To top it off, Kelly found him intelligent and funny.</p><p class=Fg>A few things almost led to the couple not getting married. Firstly it was the distance, <a class="Xd a" href=#>Kelly</a> had just moved to New York after getting a job at Fox News, and Brunt was the CEO of a tech company in Florida.</p><p class=Fg>Then something happened that caused a big fight between the couple, <a class="Xd a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.marieclaire.com/culture/a30148374/who-is-douglas-brunt/>stated</a> Marie Claire. On one New Year's Eve night, Kelly and Brunt were walking her two dogs, and Brunt accidentally lost control of one of the dogs.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.amomama.com/86cfcb9179b07002e7ce304b0de8fcd3.jpg><p class=Vi data-testid=image-source>Megyn Kelly and Douglas Brunt in New York in 2017. | Source: Getty Images</p><p class=Fg>The dog ran into the street and almost got hit by a car.

The journalist <a class="Xd a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.marieclaire.com/culture/a30148374/who-is-douglas-brunt/>reportedly</a> accused him of wanting to kill her dog.</p><p class=Fg>However, Brunt already had plans to pop the question and wanted to wait until he bought a better ring. But he was impatient and settled for a look-alike of Rose's ring from Titanic that he got at a costume store.</p><p class=Fg>As per Marie Claire, Brunt <a class="Xd a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.marieclaire.com/culture/a30148374/who-is-douglas-brunt/>asked</a> Kelly to marry him when they sat seaside on a bench in New Jersey. The talk show host confessed that she was stunned when it happened and took a while to give Brunt an answer, automatically making him think the proposal was a failure.</p><p class=Fg>But it all worked out for the couple. They married in 2008, became a family of five, and now reside in New York.
