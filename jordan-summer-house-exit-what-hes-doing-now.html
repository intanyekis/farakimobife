However, he could not keep up his explosive start because, before he realized it, his plans backfired, and the other cast members at the property in the Hamptons were left unsettled rather than entertained.</p><p>He was successful in making the majority of people feel awkward. Jordan divulged some raunchy s*xual anecdotes, some so far-fetched and unbelievable that it made his fellow reality stars question whether or not anything he had said was even somewhat accurate. Find the reason behind Jordan Verroi's exit out of Summer House and what he's been up to since then in the following article.</p><h2 id=jordan-verroi-brief-comeback-in-the-summer-house>Jordan Verroi Brief Comeback In The Summer House</h2><p>Jordan Verroi came back for season 4 of Summer House to play the role of a ‘friend,’ even though the show didn't get him on the official cast roster for the show. Verroi has not provided any indication, either on social media or in interviews, whether he resigned.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>On the other hand, a reliable source revealed that Jordan quit the show because he was scared of getting fired from his role there. Jordan allegedly found out that someone in the house was getting fired from the show, and based on his current actions, he believed that it would most likely be him.</p><p>According to one of the production staff, Jordan then decided to leave the show three weeks before filming was finished to avoid getting fired from the show. Further, according to TMZ, the insider also mentioned that Jordan was upset at being demoted to the role of 'friend’ where the producer’s initial plan didn't require him to be on the show again.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# title="This Is Why Newlyweds Kyle Cooke And Amanda Batula Don't Watch 'Summer House' Together">This Is Why Newlyweds Kyle Cooke And Amanda Batula Don't Watch 'Summer House' Together</a></span></p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">TMZ also received reports</a> on the alleged drama, some of which contradict each other, of how he came to be on display this season.

Although drama makes for good reality TV, many stars have crossed a line and their actions have real consequences.</p><p>As much drama is in Summer House and one might wonder <a href=#>why are people still watching Summer House</a>, the real drama is <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">behind the scenes with Jordan’s departure</a>. Jordan Verroi was not officially fired, as the producers made no official announcements. Hannah Berner claims the Summer House staff did the right thing by asking him to leave.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>During the show, after the group discussed evicting Jules Daoud and Jordan Verroi, Carl Radke decided to inform his housemates about the decision at Kyle Cooke's birthday party. Berner remarked in an interview that although she agrees that Jordan was indeed entertaining, Jordan's return to the show was motivated by a desire for redemption but that he made too great an effort to do it. It hit him square in the face.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# title="How Much Is ‘Summer House’ Star Kyle Cooke Worth?">How Much Is ‘Summer House’ Star Kyle Cooke Worth?</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Verroi's hookup with<a href=#> Danielle Olivera who was involved in a love triangle</a> in the house. and then regretting it the next day, then showing his desire for Paige DeSorbo did not go over well with his roommates.
