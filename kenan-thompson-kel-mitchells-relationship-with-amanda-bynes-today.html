She embarked on what seemed like an incredibly promising film career thanks to comedies like What A Girl Wants and She's the Man. Her All That co-stars Kenan Thompson and Kel Mitchell most likely thought what the rest of the world did: that Bynes had an amazing career and bright future ahead of her.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/amanda-bynes-is-isolating-herself-again-and-it-has-fans-worried-for-her-well-being.jpg><p>Sadly, Amanda Bynes was placed under a conservatorship beginning in 2013. TMZ reported that it ended in March 2022. Over the years, fans have heard rumblings that Bynes might return to acting.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In 2017, she told Diana Madison of The Lowdown, "I do miss acting, and I have something surprising to tell you: I'm going to start acting again. I want to do TV. Maybe a few guest spots on some shows that I'm a fan of and maybe another TV show where I'm the star of it, in the future. That's what I hope," according to E!

In March 2023, Entertainment Tonight reported that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Amanda Bynes missed the chance to see her co-stars at '90s Con</a>. It was a shame to hear this because she was supposed to be at the highly-anticipated festival, but the actress wasn't able to attend.</p><p>Kel Mitchell said, "I've just been praying for her. It's awesome to see she's doing better. Which is great. We're just continuing to pray for her on her journey, and it's answered prayers that she's doing a lot better."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While the actress didn't explain why she couldn't go to '90s Con, fans learned that it was related to her health.</p><p>Bynes explained to People in January 2023, "I'm really excited to reunite with my cast mates and meet the fans at '90s Con." It seems like all three cast members would have loved the opportunity to be in the same place again after so much time had passed. It definitely would have been a heartwarming moment in time.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/kel-mitchell-kenan-thompson.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>From what Kel Mitchell said, it sounds like he and Kenan Thompson loved working on All That with Amanda Bynes, but they haven't seen her much or at all in the years since she left the show.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/1-6.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="How Much Amanda Bynes' Mental Health Struggles Hurt Her Net Worth">How Much Amanda Bynes' Mental Health Struggles Hurt Her Net Worth</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>Though she was an acting icon in the late '90s and 2000s, Amanda Bynes' struggles have definitely made an impact on her net worth over the years.</p><p>While Mitchell and Thompson haven't explained what their relationship with Bynes looks like now, they haven't said that the three are close. It seems likely that Bynes's mental health struggles, conservatorship battle, and other ups and downs have made it hard for her to keep in touch with former co-stars.</p><h2 id=what-was-kel-mitchell-and-kenan-thompson-39-s-relationship-with-amanda-bynes-like-while-filming-all-that>What Was Kel Mitchell And Kenan Thompson's Relationship With Amanda Bynes Like While Filming All That?</h2><p>In 2017, Amanda Bynes surprised everyone when she was interviewed by Paper magazine and opened up quite a lot about what her life had been like. While she talked about being a child actor and using substances on movie sets, she didn't talk specifically about All That. She also didn't mention Kenan Thompson or Kel Mitchell and doesn't seem to talked about them publicly.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Amanda-Bynes-Flooded-With-TV-Offers-As-9-Year-Conservatorship-Ends.jpg><p>However, her former co-stars have praised her in the past. In April 2022, Kel Mitchell talked about All That in an interview with Yahoo! Entertainment and explained that it was fun and satisfying working with Amanda Bynes. He said that Rick Bynes, Amanda's father, asked him to teach her some comedic lessons, and he was more than happy to do so.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/kel-mitchell.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Mitchell said, "They were like, 'Hey Kel, could you, like, show Amanda physical comedy and just, like, give her some advice and things like that? And this girl… I'm talking about like a sponge. Like, listened to everything."</p><p>Mitchell also explained to Yahoo! Entertainment, "What was cool about Amanda was that she was just fearless, that's what I loved. Because I'm a physical comedian as well."</p><p>Amanda Bynes had a hilarious sketch on All That called "Ask Ashley" where she gave fans advice. In one memorable sketch, she answers a question about what to do when a parent puts peanut butter and jelly on the wrong piece of bread. Ashley gets increasingly frustrated and angry as she answers each question. This sketch is a great example of the strong comedic timing that Bynes has always had.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While there was excitement over a reboot of All That, the sketch series only returned for one season that aired in 2019 and 2020. Before fans got the chance to watch it, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Kenan Thompson hoped Amanda Bynes would appear</a> in some episodes, according to Us Weekly.</p><p>Thompson explained that he was in contact with his former co-stars. However, he didn't say that he and Bynes talked regularly, if at all. It doesn't sound like they have had much of a relationship since their days filming the original series.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/kenan-thompson.jpg><p>Like Kel Mitchell, Kenan Thompson is still a fan of Amanda Bynes, and he wished that she would star in the All That reboot. Thompson explained to Us Weekly of Bynes acting in the new episodes, "We would all love it, of course, but it would be up to her.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It's possible that Amanda Bynes could appear on a panel with her All That co-stars Kenan Thompson and Kel Mitchell at '90s Con or another festival in the future. Unless that happens, though, the three stars might not have the chance to be together again.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiinqaRo3q1tM6mp6ynnmK4priMpqCtm5iaua2%2FjKucpZmknryvv8eip2avmam1bq3MmqWdmV2Xxq%2Bx0marqJyRrnw%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fkenan-thompson-kel-mitchells-relationship-with-amanda-bynes-today.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fkenan-thompson-kel-mitchells-relationship-with-amanda-bynes-today.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fkenan-thompson-kel-mitchells-relationship-with-amanda-bynes-today.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fkenan-thompson-kel-mitchells-relationship-with-amanda-bynes-today.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fkenan-thompson-kel-mitchells-relationship-with-amanda-bynes-today.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fkenan-thompson-kel-mitchells-relationship-with-amanda-bynes-today.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./pic-sofia-vergara-wears-corset-fishnet-tights-to-play-madame-2012226.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./pic-sofia-vergara-wears-corset-fishnet-tights-to-play-madame-2012226.html>PIC: Sofia Vergara Wears Corset, Fishnet Tights to Play Madame</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./is-nija-charles-married-or-dating-her-wiki-age-husband-parents-and-net-worth.html>Is Nija Charles Married or Dating?
