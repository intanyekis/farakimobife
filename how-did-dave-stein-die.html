His journey began in the 1980s when he founded the Albany Hardcore Scene, leaving an indelible mark on the hardcore community. He was not just a legal representative; he was a DIY promoter, label creator, performer, and a catalyst for the scene’s growth.</p><h4 class=wp-block-heading style=font-size:25px><span class=ez-toc-section id=More_About_Dave_Steins_Career></span><strong>More About Dave Stein’s Career</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h4><p>Dave’s career was a multifaceted one, reflecting his unwavering commitment to punk and hardcore. He managed labels like Combined Effort and Reconstruction, releasing music from influential bands like Beyond, Supertouch, and Absolution. As an attorney, he represented notable acts, including Taking Back Sunday, contributing significantly to the hardcore and metal landscape.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading style=font-size:25px><span class=ez-toc-section id=How_did_Dave_Stein_Die_What_Actually_Happened></span><strong>How did Dave Stein Die? What Actually Happened?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Dave Stein’s sudden passing has left a void in the hearts of those who knew him. Despite facing numerous health challenges throughout his life, including a battle with cancer, he remained resilient. Dave was a proponent of a vegan diet and embraced a positive mental attitude (PMA). His relentless work ethic and ability to find humor even in the most challenging situations were legendary traits.</p><p><strong>Post below:</strong><br>Elissa Stein<br>This morning the world lost the most resilient, awe-inspiring, fierce warrior I’ve ever known: my hero and my little brother Dave Stein. He let go with grace and ease, after saying he could still fight if there was something to fight for. But it was his time.<br>Dave had cancer when he was 9 months old and battled endless illnesses and set backs his entire life, but he never, ever, like EVER let that stop him. He was PMA (positive mental attitude) and straight edge and a vegan and saw the world in pretty stark black and white. He worked harder than anyone I know. Was my personal IT guru. His shopping skills were legendary as was his ability to recall a joke at even the most challenging moments, like heading into surgery. Music was his life blood and he combined that with his singular organizational abilities to be a force as an entertainment lawyer with gold and platinum records hanging in his house. He was silly and goofy and kind and loyal and whip smart and was so grateful for his life even with all the extra hardships he had to contend with. He loved his wife beyond words, his rescue dogs who brought him such great joy, his family which sometimes drove him crazy, and his friends whom he considered family.<br>I’ve felt an extra bond with him the past 12 plus years since he’s had a piece of me inside of him. Sid, his kidney named after one of our favorite cousins, was still going strong until the very end. This photo was from June, our 12th rebirthday, as he called it, which we celebrated in the hospital with his favorite Vegan Treats cakes.</p><p>There are so many things I could share: he was morally offended at anyone who would wear competing logos like Pumas and Adidas at the same time. He owned more Champion sweatshirts than most stores have in inventory. He stopped cutting his hair and started growing a beard when his original kidney started to fail, saying his hair was the only thing that was working and he’d cut it all off when he got a new one. Bane of my mother’s existence that even with a new kidney he never chopped it which is why I always secretly thought he kept it all. I would love to know something you shared with Dave if you’d like to share it here. He was so loved and made such a positive impact in so many lives.<br>Love you bro (insert our not so secret handshake here).</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading style=font-size:25px><span class=ez-toc-section id=What_was_the_cause_of_his_death></span><strong>What was the cause of his death?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Dave Stein’s battle with pneumonia, coupled with an untreatable condition causing immense pain, led to his unexpected passing. In his final days, he chose to discontinue his medications and treatment for pneumonia, according to his sister, Erica Stein. Dave’s journey, marked by remarkable resilience, came to a peaceful end at 3 a.m. on this <a href=# data-type=link data-id="https://m.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=pfbid02CXaU6Vs6fTs5U4xeajADHcwNMSAgvD4P7rvdvMw3fT3VUZ16occM49resepKQwNkl&id=100068521310938&mibextid=Nif5oz" rel="noopener noreferrer">fateful day</a>.</p><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure><h4 class=wp-block-heading style=font-size:25px><span class=ez-toc-section id=Dave_Stein_Obituary></span><strong>Dave Stein Obituary</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h4><p>The legacy of Dave Stein extends far beyond his legal career. He will be remembered for his pivotal role in shaping the hardcore scene, his unwavering spirit in the face of adversity, and his legendary sense of humor. His passing is a profound loss to the punk and hardcore communities, where he will always be remembered as “the guy in a suit” from the In Effect ’91 New York Hardcore documentary.</p><p><strong>Post below:</strong><br>Tim McMahon<br>Tough loss today, Dave Stein was definitely one of the good guys. Just a real genuine, sincere, honest, friendly, smart, hard working, dedicated person that I always looked forward to running into and catching up with.</p><p>As a lawyer, Dave was instrumental in helping us work through the contracts when Mouthpiece signed on with Revelation and he never asked for a dime. Just a friend who willingly offered his services and walked us through a world that we weren’t very familiar with. Not that the contracts were all that complex, but Dave just extended himself to help any way he could and we appreciated it greatly.</p><p>Aside from all of that, I was always a fan of and respected what Dave had done with Combined Effort Records and all he had done for the Albany Hardcore scene in the mid to late 80’s. He left an impact that will undoubtedly last forever.<br>Check out an interview that we did with Dave on Double Cross back in 2008. Just Google “Dave Stein – Hardcore Lawyer Double Cross” and you’ll find it in the archives. Well worth a read.<br>Thanks Dave, we’re gunna miss ya.</p><p>Dave Stein’s impact on the punk and hardcore scene is immeasurable. His dedication, resilience, and contributions will forever be etched in the hearts of fans, fellow musicians, and those who had the privilege of knowing him. As the hardcore community mourns his loss, we remember Dave’s remarkable journey and celebrate the profound mark he left on the world of punk and hardcore. Rest in peace, Dave Stein, your legacy lives on.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZminqJyusb%2BNqKmgZ5ikxG6wyJ1knZmmmnq0wMSipWacmZp8</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fhow-did-dave-stein-die.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fhow-did-dave-stein-die.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fhow-did-dave-stein-die.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fhow-did-dave-stein-die.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fhow-did-dave-stein-die.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fhow-did-dave-stein-die.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./kourtney-kardashian-shows-off-bare-baby-bump-in-bikini-photo.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./kourtney-kardashian-shows-off-bare-baby-bump-in-bikini-photo.html>Kourtney Kardashian Shows Off Bare Baby Bump in Bikini: Photo</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./kenny-barnes-love-is-blind-where-are-they-now.html>What Happened To Kenny Barnes From 'Love Is Blind'?</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./kenny-barnes-love-is-blind-where-are-they-now.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
