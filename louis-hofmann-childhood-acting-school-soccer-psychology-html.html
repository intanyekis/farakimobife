He was then motivated to pursue psychology and art. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>However, he dropped that idea as well when he stopped believing that he could go in that direction.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>When I finished high school, I was also very interested in psychology — and art. But I don't believe that I'd study art or psychology, even though I was still saying that two or three years ago.</p><p>- Hofmann told <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Filmfest</a> in July 2019</p><h2>He Started Acting as a Hobby</h2><p>Louis Hofmann gave his first <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">shot</a> in front of a TV camera when his mother’s friend—who was a director at German public-broadcasting television channel&nbsp;Westdeutscher Rundfunk (WDR)—asked him to perform a small role in a children’s television series at the age of 11 in 2008.</p><p>He then continued to play the role once in a month for three years. And after three years, the then-rookie realized that he wanted to pursue a career in acting. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Speaking to <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Sleek</a> magazine in February 2017, the Dark actor remembered that particular instance and explained that he started acting as a hobby. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-171 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Hofmann explained, “Then I started acting at the age of 11 as a hobby, but I was really into it and wanted to do it so bad. Then at the age of 15, I realized that I wanted to do this as a job.”</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>Following that, the German star applied to an acting agency through which he started getting roles in television and movies.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><h2>Hofmann Made His Debut in 2010 and Still Has Not Attended Acting School</h2><p>Dark&nbsp;actor <a href=# rel=follow>Louis Hofmann made his television movie debut in the year 2010</a> when he appeared as David Salzbrenner in the movie The Lost Father (German: Der Verlorene Vater).</p><p>In the successive years, Hofmann worked in several other movies and TV shows such as Tom Sawyer, Sanctuary, Land of Mine, Red Sparrow, Prelude, Down the River, and Dark, among others.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>With such a brilliant career and heartwarming acting performances under his belt, he has kept on growing in his acting skills and fame ever since he started his acting journey.</p><p>But what is still fascinating and interesting is that Hofmann never attended any acting school. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-173 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Everything we’ve seen and he has&nbsp;showcased on-screen has&nbsp;always been his natural acting prowess.</p><p>When <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Nisimasa</a> magazine asked Hofmann why he never attended an acting school, the actor shared that he couldn’t tell if acting classes were necessary for him. “I can’t really tell if it is necessary. I just know it has worked out so far,” he said.</p><p>Later, the young actor also revealed his intentions of learning acting in the future and that he&nbsp;would “spend three or six months in an actors’ studio” either in New York or Los Angeles to learn acting.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGicp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX6G8trXSZp%2Bonp2Wu695wqGgpZyYpLylecCcq6Kml2LApLTOqKNmq5%2BYsKa%2BjKmqspuYpLmws9hnn62lnA%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2flouis-hofmann-childhood-acting-school-soccer-psychology-html.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2flouis-hofmann-childhood-acting-school-soccer-psychology-html.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2flouis-hofmann-childhood-acting-school-soccer-psychology-html.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2flouis-hofmann-childhood-acting-school-soccer-psychology-html.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2flouis-hofmann-childhood-acting-school-soccer-psychology-html.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2flouis-hofmann-childhood-acting-school-soccer-psychology-html.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./alison-berns-bio-height-net-worth-husband.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./alison-berns-bio-height-net-worth-husband.html>Alison Berns- Bio, Height, Net Worth, Husband</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./what-is-charlie-foxtrot-meaning-in-military-twitter-reaction.html>What Is Charlie Foxtrot?
