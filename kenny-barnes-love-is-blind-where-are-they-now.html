The contestants on the show made it a hit, and <a href=#>they've had plenty to say about one another</a> since the season debuted.</p><p>A lot has changed since the show's first season, and fans want an update on key cast members, including Kenny Barnes. Let's see what he's been up to.</p><h2 id=kenny-barnes-was-featured-on-39-love-is-blind-39-season-one>Kenny Barnes Was Featured On 'Love Is Blind' Season One</h2><p>In the earlier part of 2020, people suddenly found themselves with a surplus of Netflix binge time, and one of the hottest shows to emerge from that time was Love is Blind. While there were plenty of other dating shows for people to watch, this series hit Netflix at just the right time and became a massive hit with fans.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Featuring a group of hopeful singles getting to know one another without actually meeting face-to-face, this show was all about establishing an emotional connection before getting engaged and marching towards a wedding date. The idea was brilliant, and fans were hooked from the show's first episode.</p><p>Kenny Barnes was a contestant on the show, and he got engaged to Kelly Chase. The duo's chemistry was solid, and they were heading in the right direction all throughout the show.</p><p>As fans came to learn, however, things weren't really what they seemed on camera.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>'Love Is Blind' Season 2 Episode 3 Review: 'Love In Paradise'</a></span></p><h2 id=kenny-and-kelly-didn-39-t-get-married>Kenny And Kelly Didn't Get Married</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>When it came down to making the final decision to stay together, Kenny and Kelly went their separate ways. The duo had feelings for one another and seemed to be heading in the right direction, but they were not meant to last.</p><p>After the fallout of their engagement, Kenny opened up about his approach to the show, which included not getting married at the end.</p><p>"We were adamant about we’re not going to get married. And really, the engagement was just to extend the experiment. And we were both committed to that," <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Kenny revealed</a>.</p><p>Kelly and Kenny were planning on remaining a couple, but Kenny pulled away, which came as a surprise to Kelly.</p><p>"I actually wrote him a handwritten letter, not like saying like, ‘I’m in love with you,’ not crazy, but just like, ‘I really enjoyed getting to know you, and I do love you and I want to continue loving getting to know you even more.' I never got a response from it, which maybe just freaked him out, but I was just releasing a lot of emotions," she said.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Fans were sad to see that Kelly and Kenny didn't make it last, but they will be happy to know that things have gotten much better for Barnes.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>'Love Is Blind' Season 2 Episode 2 Review: 'Love Triangles'</a></span></p><h2 id=kenny-barnes-ended-up-finding-love-elsewhere>Kenny Barnes Ended Up Finding Love Elsewhere</h2><p>So, what's the latest with Love is Blind's Kenny Barnes? Well, while he did not find true love on the show, he did lock down the love of his life away from the cameras.</p><p>In August 2020, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">People</a> reported that Kenny got engaged to his girlfriend, Alexandra Garrison.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"On Aug. 7, the 28-year-old reality star proposed to girlfriend Alexandra Garrison at Duke Mansion in Charlotte, North Carolina, after dating a little over one year, he reveals exclusively to PEOPLE. The pair met after Barnes' appearance on the Netflix dating series, which was filmed in fall 2018," the site reported.</p><p>Fans of Love is Blind were certainly curious to see how Kelly would react to the news, and she had some sweet words for Barnes and his bride to be.</p><p>"OH MY GOSHH YAYYY!! That’s so exciting!!! I’m so excited for you two. My mouth dropped but in the best way!!!!! You deserve all the happiness Kenny!!!! Sending you both love and light! Hope to meet her someday," she posted on social media.</p><p>It's really cool to see that these two have remained so cordial after their time together, and Barnes must have really appreciated the support that Kelly gave him and his fiancé.</p><p>On the career front, Kenny is still attached to Team Lighting in Specification Sales and Lighting Control, per the company's website.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Love Is Blind Season 2 Episode 1 Review: 'The Pods Are Open!'</a></span></p><p>Ultimately, things did not work out for Kenny Barnes on Love is Blind, but in the long run, he ended up with the right person at the right time.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>'Love Is Blind' Hosts Nick And Vanessa Lachey's Real Love Story</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiinqaernqjrdGnnKxlnKTDpnnIrGSbpJmjsW7Dx56pnmWRp7JuwMeesGamn6x8</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fkenny-barnes-love-is-blind-where-are-they-now.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fkenny-barnes-love-is-blind-where-are-they-now.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fkenny-barnes-love-is-blind-where-are-they-now.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fkenny-barnes-love-is-blind-where-are-they-now.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fkenny-barnes-love-is-blind-where-are-they-now.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fkenny-barnes-love-is-blind-where-are-they-now.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./how-did-dave-stein-die.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./how-did-dave-stein-die.html>How did Dave Stein Die ?
