Some ex-wives would have their famous ex-husbands taken out if they had the opportunity. There isn't a lot of love lost between exes in the world. This isn't a simple matter of a man and a woman having beef. We're talking pissed off ex-wives of celebrity men. And if there's one thing you know about the wives of the rich and famous, it's that they're super high-maintenance and tremendously needy. The fact that their money train was cut off, and they no longer get their weekly allowance is enough to send any frantic Beverly Hills housewife insane. They can literally lose their minds if they can't go shopping with their gold cards on Rodeo Drive. It's sad&nbsp;but true.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Now, in all seriousness, with any normal relationship, when someone cheats on a spouse, there's tremendous difficulty, and there can be heartbreak. But in the celebrity world, this can be tenfold. And if it's a woman who got screwed over, as we'll discuss here, it's not far-fetched to imagine how badly they would want to exact revenge on their exes. If there's any luck that goes their way, they would somehow still have the power of attorney, and after a terrible accident, they would have that rare opportunity to pull the plug with a smile. It's morbid and vindictive, but we're talking about Beverly Hills housewives, and that's pretty much on par for those spoiled-rotten ladies. So let's take a look at some women who would love to pull that plug on their former husbands!</p><h2 id=denise-richards-and-charlie-sheen><strong>Denise Richards and Charlie Sheen</strong></h2><p>Honestly, you can't even get angry at <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Denise Richards</a> over this one. First off, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Charlie Sheen</a> is an absolute trainwreck. Sure, if you're a dude and are his friend, he's probably hilarious to hang out with and is the life of the party. But if you have to be this guy's wife, it's probably a much different story. Not only does Sheen make no qualms about his massive use of drugs or his constant need to have prostitutes or strippers in his bed (ring the AIDS bell now), but the guy has gone off on some pretty nasty rants concerning his ex-wife, Richards. And understand, Denise Richards got temporary custody of Sheen and his next crazy drug-obsessed wife's (<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Brooke Mueller</a>) kids for a period of time. So she not only had Sheen's kids with her&nbsp;but his kids with his next wife as well. Talk about awkward and annoying. Sheen went on Twitter to call Richards "a shake down piece of sh*t doosh phace & worse mom alive! A despicable charlatan who sux ISIs ass [sic]." Yeah, we think she would definitely pull that plug!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=elin-nordegren-and-tiger-woods><strong>Elin Nordegren and Tiger Woods</strong></h2><p>Nanny turned model/celebrity wife <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Elin Nordegren</a> ended up in one of the most scandalous celebrity breakups in recent memory. Things culminated on a dark Thanksgiving for the couple and parents of two when Nordegren was taking swings at Tiger Woods with his own golf clubs. Then, she tried to run him down on the road. The entire incident was due to Woods's infidelities with NUMEROUS other women. The line of strippers, models, restaurant managers, etc. started to build like the Indiana Jones ride at Disneyland. There were too many "other" women to even count, and clearly, Nordegren will never forget the moment she found out Woods was a serial cheater. Woods would later claim that he was a "sex addict." His golf career has never been the same since.</p><h2 id=angelina-jolie-and-brad-pitt><strong>Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt</strong></h2><p>One bad plane ride, a "worldly" family, and two massive egos led to this odd ending. How does the hottest celebrity duo in Hollywood take a single private plane as a family and exit a broken home? Well, there's a lot of explaining to do there. But the stories started leaking out worse than <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Donald Trump</a>'s White House, with many of them pointing at <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Brad Pitt</a> for alcohol, drug, and possible child abuse. The claims were extraordinary and were taken so seriously that Pitt had to agree to supervised visits with his own children after the couple officially separated. Heading toward a potentially messy divorce, Pitt was clearly blindsided by <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jolie</a>'s assault, and she seemed determined to go hardcore after her soon-to-be ex-husband.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=jennifer-aniston-and-brad-pitt><strong>Jennifer Aniston and Brad Pitt</strong></h2><p>Hey, welcome back, Brad! <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jennifer Aniston</a> was one of the hottest young actresses in Hollywood. Her role as Rachel Green on Friends catapulted her into the public eye. Everyone couldn't wait to see what her next hairstyle was like. Aniston then fell for Brad Pitt, and the two got married. They were THE celebrity couple of their time. The tabloids and paparazzi couldn't stop snapping shots of them. Then, Brad Pitt did a little movie called Mr. and Mrs. Smith with serial marriage-destroyer, Angelina Jolie. Pitt immediately fell for Jolie, and the two carried on an affair that sunk the power-couple's marriage. Aniston was publicly embarrassed while Pitt and Jolie quietly began the process of bringing tiny refugees from other parts of the world back with them after their vacations -- aka their adopted kids. We're guessing Pitt doesn't want Aniston holding the plug if he's on life support.</p><h2 id=hugh-grant-and-elizabeth-hurley><strong>Hugh Grant and Elizabeth Hurley</strong></h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Hugh Grant</a> is known as quite the lady's man, a Brit with quick wit. And his and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Elizabeth Hurley</a>'s relationship qualified as common law marriage with nearly 14 years of being together. However, their relationship took an ugly turn when Hugh Grant had a nasty prostitute stick her head in the "naughty" place while driving on a dark night on Sunset Blvd in Los Angeles, California. The cops were right there for the massive embarrassment that nearly took down the career of the lovable Brit whom everyone was drawn to. Amazingly, he was in Los Angeles to promote a big movie he was starring in and despite the incident, still managed to appear in most of his public appearances, swallowing his pride (which was WAY more than that prostitute took down) and was championed for being honest. But clearly, his relationship with Hurley, an incredibly hot Brit in her own right, was on life support, and a few years later, she stuck the inevitable fork in their relationship.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=maria-shiver-and-arnold-schwarzenegger><strong>Maria Shiver and Arnold Schwarzenegger</strong></h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Maria Shriver</a> and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Arnold Schwarzenegger</a> were an interesting pairing romantically but also politically. First off, Schwarzenegger was a former weightlifter turned A-list actor. Meanwhile, Shriver was part of the Kennedy clan, American political royalty for the Democratic Party. So when they fell for one another and got married, it was an odd combination. After years of family success, after years of making millions upon millions of dollars in earnings, and after Schwarzenegger had ridden his fame and Shriver's family legacy to a California Governorship, things imploded. It happened when a crazy picture of a teenage Latino version of Schwarzenegger surfaced, and the truth came to light. An affair with the family's Latino nanny from years prior yielded a child to whom Schwarzenegger had made hush payments for years. It would be the undoing of the marriage as more rumors and accusations of Schwarzenegger's inappropriate relationships came to light, thus ending their long run together.</p><h2 id=demi-moore-and-ashton-kutcher><strong>Demi Moore and Ashton Kutcher</strong></h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Demi Moore</a> will go down as one of the most beautiful brunette actresses to dawn the big screen. The A-list actress was part of the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Bruce Willis</a>-Demi Moore super-couple. They were married and had kids together, but their love fizzled out. Demi Moore was impressive, going from beautiful to beautiful with much larger boobs. And along the way, she met up with a young up-and-comer by the name of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Ashton Kutcher</a>. The attraction went both ways, but traditionally, when a woman as powerful and sexy as Demi Moore is older than her male counterpart, things could get a little hairy with a 15-year age gap. And then you mix in cheating rumors... yeah. So, the two called it quits after 8 years of marriage, and Kutcher went the other way by marrying his childhood sweetheart, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Mila Kunis</a> (and by childhood sweetheart, we mean Kunis was a legally still an under-aged child with the early 20s Kutcher hooking up with her back in the day). The ordeal sent Moore into a depression spiral that she'll never completely forget.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=sandra-bullock-and-jesse-james><strong>Sandra Bullock and Jesse James</strong></h2><p>Well, if there are two main certainties in life -- death and taxes, we're gonna add a third. You never, and we mean NEVER screw over America's sweetheart! And that's the tale of the dirty and overrated <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jesse James</a>,&nbsp;who married <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Sandra Bullock</a>. Bullock is pretty but not a classic hourglass model. She's adored by fans and is an "every woman." Jesse James, on the other hand, was always a bit of a misfit. He was well known to have some indiscretions in the past, including having some scandalous affairs with strippers. So, it was a surprise to everyone that Bullock and James not only started dating but also tied the knot. However, rumors of his cheating quickly went public, and James went from 'husband to America's sweetheart' to a cheating scumbag who went back to his tattoo-laced strippers. James had an embarrassing public apology, but that didn't save their marriage. We're guessing Bullock would gladly pull the plug on James!</p><h2 id=kendra-wilkinson-and-hank-baskett><strong>Kendra Wilkinson and Hank Baskett</strong></h2><p>Cheaters beware. There are varying degrees of cheating that can cause jaw-dropping moments for the public. Let's set the scene on this one. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Kendra Wilkinson</a> is a beautiful blonde Playboy bunny with an extraordinary body and an even bigger ego to go with it. She's evolved from sleeping with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Hugh Hefner</a> to having her own&nbsp;E&nbsp;reality television series. In addition to that, she's also become a successful novelist who loves to throw people under the bus as she begs for attention. Wilkinson has made quite the career for herself. Her husband, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Hank Baskett</a>, was a successful NFL football player. He wasn't a star, but he was a solid dude. So, when Baskett cheated on his Playmate wife, everyone was pretty surprised. When we learned that it was with a transgender woman, we were brought to another level of surprise. Ouch... that one was not a good memory for the family scrapbook.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=ben-affleck-and-jennifer-garner><strong>Ben Affleck and Jennifer Garner</strong></h2><p>Let's talk nannies! We're talking about those young, beautiful women that help celebrities take care of their kids. For some reason, the vast majority of these nannies tend to be young models-in-the-making. So, when a celebrity wife is off filming a movie, her celebrity hubby may be spending a bit more one-on-one time with that super-hottie star-struck nanny. And guess what? Sh*t happens. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Ben Affleck</a> started one such affair with his nanny. The hot nanny was Christine Ouzounian. The couple immediately split when <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Garner</a> got confirmation of her husband's wandering eye. Affleck has since attempted to get back into good graces with his love. But despite rekindling their friendship, divorce is still in the cards and proceeding forward.</p><h2 id=robyn-moore-and-mel-gibson><strong>Robyn Moore and Mel Gibson</strong></h2><p>When looking at costly divorce proceedings, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Mel Gibson</a>'s breakup with Robyn Moore is almost legendary when it comes to cost. Gibson met Moore in 1977 shortly after he filmed his hit movie, Mad Max.&nbsp;After that, they went on to have seven children together but separated after 26 years of marriage when Gibson's drinking became too much for Moore to handle. Gibson's drinking, rants and, relationship with new hot girlfriend, Oksana Grigorieva, put the final nail in their marriage. To further complicate things, Gibson was going on crazy DUI rants that didn't help much. Gibson put Moore through the ringer, but it would be the $425 million that Gibson paid out to Moore that was an epic financial slam.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=ali-landry-and-mario-lopez><strong>Ali Landry and Mario Lopez</strong></h2><p>This story is comical for a number of reasons. First off, they were married for such a short period of time, if you blinked, you may have missed both the wedding and the divorce. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Mario Lopez</a> and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Ali Landry</a> were longtime lovers but fell victim to a stale marriage. 14 days was too much for Lopez to handle. News emerged that the former&nbsp;Saved by the Bell&nbsp;star was a serial cheater. He admitted to cheating on Landry prior to their marriage at his bachelor's party in Mexico. Lopez was still too immature to handle marriage, and when photos surfaced of Lopez messing around in Mexico on his excursion, that settled that. Needless to say, Landry was not amused and was mortified by the incident. Thus, if there's a plug to pull, she'll be first in line to help Lopez make his journey to the "other side."</p><h2 id=uma-thurman-and-ethan-hawke><strong>Uma Thurman and Ethan Hawke&nbsp;</strong></h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Uma Thurman</a> and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Ethan Hawke</a> seemed like the perfect young celebrity couple. They were married for six years, but that marriage came crashing down when Hawke fell for their nanny, Ryan Shawhughes. Thurman and Hawke fell in love during the filming of&nbsp;Gattaca.&nbsp;From there, they went on to get married and have two children. Their nanny, Ryan Shawhughes, was incredibly helpful. And after a few years, it became apparent that Hawke and Thurman were heading toward a sad end. They surprisingly separated and divorced, and then Hawke got married a few years later to that same former nanny, Shawhughes. In responding to cheating rumors, Hawke states that human beings aren't meant to be monogamous and that people who define others as cheaters are juvenile. Uma is definitely pulling the plug on him.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=sienna-miller-and-jude-law><strong>Sienna Miller and Jude Law</strong></h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Sienna Miller</a> had a wonderful, dramatic relationship with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jude Law</a>. The two were incredibly passionate lovers. There were constant rumors of cheating as the couple seemed to constantly break up and make up again and again. The 2004 film&nbsp;Alfie&nbsp;brought them together. Their on-screen chemistry led to their off-screen romance. It took less than a year for the two star-crossed lovers to get engaged. BUT... Jude Law decided to have an affair with their nanny, Daisy Wright. The nanny outed the relationship, and Law had to make a public apology to Miller. They broke up. Then, Law and Miller attempted to get back together, but she cheated on him, this time, with James Bond himself, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Daniel Craig</a>. Incredibly, after breaking up again, they got back together 3 years later in 2009. Their relationship would finally end for good in 2011. We're thinking these two would pull the plugs on each other at the end of the day.</p><h2 id=eva-longoria-and-tony-parker><strong>Eva Longoria and Tony Parker</strong></h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Eva Longoria</a> was flying sky-high with her role in&nbsp;Desperate Housewives, and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Tony Parker</a>, the French point guard for the San Antonio Spurs, was busy establishing himself as one of the premier point guards in the NBA. While Longoria was winning awards for her acting, Parker was winning NBA Championships. It seemed like a match made in heaven until Longoria discovered "hundreds" of texts from a mystery woman on Parker's phone. Their marriage would implode over the cheating revelations and end after only three years of being together. Parker moved on and "matured," seemingly handling his stardom and being a bit better as a husband in round 2 during his current marriage to wife, journalist&nbsp;Axelle Francine.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=hillary-and-bill-clinton><strong>Hillary and Bill Clinton</strong></h2><p>And we arrive at the mother of all cheating scandals, that of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Hillary</a> and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Bill Clinton</a>. First off, this one started well before Bill even got into office. He was running for president, and it seemed the rumors were already flying around about his numerous romps with other women. There was a hairstylist, amongst others. But it would be his indiscretions with his 24-year-old White House intern, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Monica Lewinsky</a>, that drew the ire of the entire free world. There were rumors of a cigar being used as a sexual instrument, amongst other scandalous facts, and at first, Bill Clinton attempted to deny the affair had ever happened. However, there was an avalanche of truth that made it clear Bill Clinton had had extramarital affairs. The nearly impeached US President was a big-time embarrassment for Hillary, an acclaimed attorney. Hand the chord, and she'll gladly pull that plug!</p><p><strong>Sources: Daily Mail; Wikipedia; Mirror</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmsKeiobFusc2tnKuskZ67rrHNrWZqbl2brq671KxknrBdrLa3sdJmrqGnlGK9trjLZquhnV2lubazjKilZqyYmrazecWoqaadomK1tr%2FBmqWdq18%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2f16-famous-ex-wives-whod-pull-the-plug-on-their-former-husbands.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2f16-famous-ex-wives-whod-pull-the-plug-on-their-former-husbands.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2f16-famous-ex-wives-whod-pull-the-plug-on-their-former-husbands.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2f16-famous-ex-wives-whod-pull-the-plug-on-their-former-husbands.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2f16-famous-ex-wives-whod-pull-the-plug-on-their-former-husbands.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2f16-famous-ex-wives-whod-pull-the-plug-on-their-former-husbands.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./bull-net-worth.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./bull-net-worth.html>Bull Cast Net Worth Richest Cast Members Salary</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./lady-tigra-bunny-d-ltrimm-now-photos.html>Lady Tigra and Bunny D of L'Trimm 'Memba Them?!</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./lady-tigra-bunny-d-ltrimm-now-photos.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
