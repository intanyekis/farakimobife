The story of a blended family, we saw Carol and Mike join together with their kids, creating a family of six. Thankfully, Carol and Mike had kids that were all similar in age. We had Marcia and Greg as the eldest of the brood, Jan and Peter as the middle children, and Cindy and Bobby as the youngest.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Top 10 Richest Actors in the World of 2019</a></span></p><p>As the five seasons charged on, we watched this family go through everything other families were going through. The difficulties of raising a blended family, kids growing up and wanting independence, boyfriend/girlfriend troubles â€” there was something so charming about them all.</p><p>Since it's been 45 years since the show wrapped up, we're taking a look at what some of our favorite characters look like today and remembering those who've passed on.</p><h2 id=mike-lookinland-bobby-brady>MIKE LOOKINLAND: BOBBY BRADY</h2><p>Mike Lookinland portrayed the youngest of the Brady crew, Bobby Brady. Bobby was adventurous, curious, and playful by nature. He also got along swimmingly with Cindy, who was similar in age.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In comparison to other actors on the show, Mike didn't do too much after&nbsp;The Brady Bunch&nbsp;ended. He did the show's various spinoffs and a few TV movies but he's most known for his reoccurring role of Bobby. Today, Mike is 58, married, and has two children.</p><h2 id=susan-olsen-cindy-brady>SUSAN OLSEN: CINDY BRADY</h2><p>Susan Olsen played everyone's favorite little sister, Cindy Brady. She had an adorable baby face, blonde pigtails, and an endearing lisp that made her a TV legend.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>10 Most Well-Paid Voice Actors</a></span></p><p>After&nbsp;The Brady Bunch&nbsp;ended, Susan stayed in the spotlight but ventured into graphic design, hosting, and becoming an author. She starred in a few of the show's spinoffs and different TV shows. Today, Susan is twice divorced, respectfully, and has one son.</p><h2 id=christopher-knight-peter-brady>CHRISTOPHER KNIGHT: PETER BRADY</h2><p>Christopher Knight played Peter Brady, the middle child of the group. He was quite sensitive in comparison to Bobby or Greg and was equally clumsy. Nevertheless, viewers adored him.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>After the show ended, Christopher also joined on to many of the show's spinoffs but he dabbled in other works as well. He also made a slight comeback thanks to his reality TV show with ex-wife Adrianne Curry. These days, Knight is married and just appeared on HGTV's A Very Brady Renovation.</p><h2 id=eve-plumb-jan-brady>EVE PLUMB: JAN BRADY</h2><p>Eve Plumb played the sweet Jan Brady. As the middle child, Jan was very jealous of her siblings' achievements, especially Marcia's. She was beautiful and smart but always compared herself to other people, which made her all the more relatable.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>The 10 Richest Kid Actors Ever</a></span></p><p>Today, Eve is still acting and even had roles on&nbsp;Army Wives,&nbsp;That '70s Show,&nbsp;and&nbsp;Blue Bloods. She's been married since the late '90s and has spent her free time painting, which has been beautifully received.</p><h2 id=barry-williams-greg-brady>BARRY WILLIAMS: GREG BRADY</h2><p>Barry Williams portrayed everyone's favorite big brother, Greg. Greg was a young man who always thought he was more of a man than he actually was. He desperately wanted to be suave and mature and we all loved him for it.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Barry went on to complete the various Brady Bunch spinoffs and is still acting today.

In 2008, she penned a book&nbsp;<i>Here's the Story: Surviving Marcia Brady </i>and<i> Finding My True Voice</i>. Sadly, like many child actors, Maureen suffered addiction issues but has since become sober and is living happily with her husband.</p><h2 id=florence-henderson-carol-brady>FLORENCE HENDERSON: CAROL BRADY</h2><p>Florence Henderson played Carol Brady, America's favorite mom. She was protective, loyal, and caring of her family and made sure her "adopted" sons were seen as her own. She was also deeply in love with her husband Mike.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Sadly, at the age of 82, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Florence</a> passed away suddenly on Thanksgiving Day due to heart failure.

He <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">thought</a> some of the storylines were silly or unrealistic was afraid this role would ruin his chance at other, more serious roles.</p><p>In the '90s, Reed sadly passed away from colon cancer.</p><h2 id=ann-b-davis-alice-nelson>ANN B. DAVIS: ALICE NELSON</h2><p>Ann B. Davis played the Bradys' loving and devoted housekeeper. She helped Carol and Mike raise the kids and kept their home nice and tidy. But before Ann took the role of Alice, she was known for her time on&nbsp;The Bob Cummings Show for which she won two Primetime Emmy Awards for.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>She continued acting through the '90s until she passed away in 2014 from a brain injury she received after falling.

He was known for his quick jabs and funny puns with Alice and the Bradys.</p><p>But actor Allan Melvin was known for much more than his role as Sam. He was on&nbsp;<i>The Andy Griffith Show,</i>&nbsp;All in the Family,&nbsp;and did voice work for&nbsp;The Jetsons.
