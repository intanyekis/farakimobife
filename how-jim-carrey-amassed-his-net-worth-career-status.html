He has three other siblings and they were all raised in a Catholic household. His father Percy was a musician and provided well for his family, but he soon lost his job. Carrey had to quit school in order to help his family by working as a janitor.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Nevertheless, throughout his childhood, Jim always had a talent for comedy. He was noticed by comedian Rodney Dangerfield, who signed the young man to open his tour performances. Dangerfield would later take Carrey to Las Vegas to perfect his comedy act.</p><h2 id=jim-carrey-39-s-early-work>Jim Carrey's Early Work</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/instar49738112-1.jpg><p>After his stint in Las Verga, Carrey would later move to Hollywood where he performed in The Comedy Store in 1982. This was followed by his debuting on national television performing a bit on The Tonight Show.</p><p>Carrey then applied to NBC's <a href=# rel=nofollow>Saturday Night Live</a> as a cast member but was not selected for the part. But, not all was lost as from 1990 to 1994, he would become a regular cast member of the comedy series In Living Color.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Carrey earned $25,000 per episode for his comedic work.</p><h2 id=jim-carrey-39-s-rise-to-fame>Jim Carrey's Rise to Fame</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/instar50349143-1.jpg><p>In 1994, Carrey's illustrious career in Hollywood would begin when he was cast in the leading role in three separate movies. Each of the films, Ace Ventura: Pet Detective ($107 million), The Mask ($351 million), and Dumb and Dumber ($247 million), became a big commercial success.</p><p>Despite the success, Carrey only earned $350,000 and $540,000 from the first two films. That all changed for Dumb and Dumber though, as Carrey was <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">paid $7 million for being the leading man.</a> Unfortunately, his co-star, Jeff Daniels, who was on board with Carrey to <a href=# rel=nofollow>not wear wigs for the film</a>, was not as lucky and <a href=# rel=nofollow>made only a fraction of what Carrey did for the film</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>This did not deter <a href=# rel=nofollow>Daniels from working with Carrey again in the future</a>, however, as he would go on to narrate Carrey's book, Memoirs and Misinformation.</p><p>In 1995, Jim portrayed one of the villains, The Riddler, in the superhero movie Batman: Forever ($336 million). The movie received mixed reviews but was a box-office success. His second role that year was the comedy sequel Ace Ventura: When Nature Calls ($212 million). Unlike the previous movie, the Canadian actor got a huge pay increase and netted $15 million for the role.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel=nofollow>Every Jim Carrey Movie That Made Over $100 Million</a></span></p><h2 id=jim-carrey-was-hollywood-39-s-highest-paid-actor-in-the-late-1990s>Jim Carrey Was Hollywood's Highest-Paid Actor In The Late 1990s</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/instar50323763-1.jpg><p>To the dismay of his fans, Carrey would only star in one movie for the next two years.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In 1996, Carrey's starred with director Ben Stiller (Stiller's third movie as a director) in the dark comedy Cable Guy ($102 million).

But despite the discrepancy in reviews, Carrey earned a whopping $20 million in each of his last two films, <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">becoming one of the first actors to do so.</a> As such, Carry became one of the highest-paid actors in the late 1990s.</p><h2 id=jim-carrey-39-s-highest-salary-for-a-movie>Jim Carrey's Highest Salary For A Movie</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/instar50333125-1.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Throughout the next two decades, Carrey would continue to be featured in many movie projects from different genres.

And both they are critics were impressed with his work in Eternal Sunshine of The Spotless Mind (2004), Number 23 (2007), and A Christmas Carol (2009).</p><p>However, the biggest payday he ever got was in the most unlikely comedy film, Yes Man.</p><p>Carrey decided to make a bet on the success of the movie by not getting paid at all in exchange for having 36% of the movie's back-end profits. This meant if the movie failed at the box office, Carrey would make only a small salary from it.</p><p>Luck proved to be on Carrye's side, however.

The movie became the second-highest-grossing film of 2020, bringing in over $300 million. It was also the highest-grossing video game film adaptation in the United States and Canada, surpassing Detective Pikachu.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The last TV role Carrey was a part of was Kidding, a comedy-drama TV series. Its second and final season aired in February-March 2020.</p><p>While Carrey has decided to slow down his acting career, he has made cameos both in The Weeknd's music video, Out of Time, and his short, the Dawn FM Experience.</p><p>Carrey has also dedicated much of his time over the past decade to his art. While the bulk of his fortune is from his acting career, the prints of Carrey's work go for $800 and the originals go for much more. <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">The art is not done to make an income, however</a>, as Carrey donates anything he makes to charity. It is done instead to "free" the actor.
