But it appears the actor has stepped away from the spotlight in exchange for a less glamorous job – selling time shares.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Last year, it was reported Armie was spending time in the Cayman Islands following a stint in rehab. Photos showed The Social Network star enjoying the topics with his children, Harper, 7, and Ford, 5. Armie was married to Elizabeth Chambers for a decade <a href=#>before they divorced in 2020</a>.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Erika Girardi Facing $55M Lawsuit That Claims She Knew Of Hubby’s Fraud</a></span></p><p>The following year, a string of abuse allegations against Armie came to light. In January 2021, an anonymous Instagram account shared screenshots of texts the actor allegedly sent to multiple women. The texts described graphic sexual fantasies, including cannibalism and rape.</p><p>A woman who claims to have dated the J. Edgar star later gave an interview to Page Six about their relationship. She said he subjected her to emotional abuse and she suffered PTSD at the end of their months-long relationship.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"If I had a little cut on my hand, he'd like suck it or lick it. That's about as weird as we got,” she claimed.</p><p>Another women told the outlet that Armie branded her with his initial during their time together, adding he said he wanted to "barbeque and eat her rib.” Armie has denied all of the allegations, even though a sexual assault investigation was launched against him. The case may be ongoing.</p><p>However, the accusations took a huge toll on the actor’s career. He was dropped from many upcoming projects, and his <a href=#>talent agency confirmed they were no longer representing him</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Now, it appears he’s found a new gig in the Cayman Islands. Photographs published by <a href=#>TMZ</a> show the actor in a hotel uniform speaking to a couple about the benefits of a time share. He reportedly was trying to sell a package that would cost the buyers $2,021 per week or $21,000 for a decade worth of vacations.</p><p>The rumors of Armie’s new gig first began circulating when Desus & Mero producer Muna Mire shared a flyer advertising the time share selling business.</p><p>The flyer featured an image of Armie, and says he can coordinate special tours for guests with a discount.“I am your personal concierge and am here to help you get the very best from your vacation,” it read.</p><p>"My friend's parents went on vacation in the Cayman Islands and armie hammer was their concierge," Muna tweeted alongside an image of the flyer. "I'm still not over it."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Even though he was pictured in a blue polo like other hotel staff, Armie’s lawyer denies that he’s working at the resort, and said the flyer was a prank. He says the actor is friends with the hotel’s owner, which is why he’s often seen at the resort. He couldn’t confirm or deny whether Armie is selling time shares, though.</p><p>“I don’t have any additional information,” attorney Andrew Brettler told <a href=#>Variety</a>.</p><p>Additionally, an employee of the hotel told the publication that Armie is a guest, not an employee, and that the flyer was circulated as a prank. However, this doesn’t explain why Armie was dressed in uniform and pitching to hotel guests.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>Paul Simon Loses Millions After Selling Connecticut Estate</a></span></p><p>Sources; <a href=#>Variety</a>, <a href=#>TMZ</a>,</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqxu9aeqZ%2BtnGSus7nInmShmZ2isrN5yKxkrJ2cobavs4ytoKadXai1or7ErGSanqSav26%2B1KKloqaXYrWqv4yamq2hnpx6pK3RnpyrZw%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2farmie-hammer-is-selling-time-shares-after-ruining-his-acting-career.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2farmie-hammer-is-selling-time-shares-after-ruining-his-acting-career.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2farmie-hammer-is-selling-time-shares-after-ruining-his-acting-career.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2farmie-hammer-is-selling-time-shares-after-ruining-his-acting-career.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2farmie-hammer-is-selling-time-shares-after-ruining-his-acting-career.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2farmie-hammer-is-selling-time-shares-after-ruining-his-acting-career.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./james-digiacomo.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./james-digiacomo.html>James DiGiacomo</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./tyra-banks-nose-job-picture.html>Tyra Banks Had a Nose Job, Plastic Surgery in Early Career</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./tyra-banks-nose-job-picture.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
