He has a lot of fans. With an estimated <strong>net worth of $4 million</strong>, he is becoming even more eligible in both his professional and personal lives.</p><h2>Ed Westwick’s Biography and Family</h2><p>Edward Jack Peter Westwick was born on June 28, 1987, in Stevenage, Hertfordshire, England. He is of British ancestry.</p><p>Peter and Carole Westwick were his parents when he was born.</p><p>Ed’s father is an educational psychologist, and his mother is a university lecturer. With three brothers, he grew up as the youngest.</p><p>Ed received his education at the Barclay School and later at North Hertfordshire College. At the age of six, he enrolled in a drama school, and after college, he joined the National Youth Theatre in London.</p><p>He also stands at a height of 5 feet 9 inches (1.75 meters). In terms of his weight, Ed was chastised in 2009 for his rapid weight gain during the third season of Gossip Girl, which forced the production to purchase an entirely new wardrobe for him. He did, however, regain his fitness after a brief period of miraculous weight loss.</p><h2>Wife or Dating of Ed Westwick</h2><p>Needless to say, the ladies man has had his fair share of love affairs and relationships.</p><p>Ed began dating Jessica Szohr, his Gossip Girl co-star, in 2008. They were a match made in heaven. Unfortunately, after four years of being together in an on-again, off-again relationship, they had to part ways.</p><h4>More on Jessica Szohr: Jessica Szohr’s Boyfriend, Ethnicity, and Dating</h4><p>Prior to his relationship with Jessica, Ed had a fling with Drew Barrymore in 2008. At a concert, the two were photographed kissing.</p><p>Ed stayed out of the dating scene for a while after his breakup with Jessica and kept a low profile. However, Ed and his girlfriend, Jessica Serfaty, re-entered the dating scene in 2017. They were even rumored to be planning a wedding.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/liverampup.com/uploads/images/celebrity/Ed-Westwick-Jessica-Serfaty2.JPG><p>However, things changed in November 2017, when Ed was accused of sexual assault by two women. Despite the fact that the accusations were unfounded, Ed was chastised as a result of the incident.</p><p>Jessica stood by Ed’s side even when he was in the midst of a crisis. The couple’s union, however, did not last forever, as they mutually parted ways in September 2018.</p><h4>After Divorce, Jessica Serfaty is Accused by Her Husband! Is There Really an Abandoned Son?</h4><p>Apart from his relationships with attractive women, Ed has also been accused of being gay due to his close friendship with Chace Crawford. During the filming of the series, the Gossip Girl co-stars shared a room.

Having said that, on January 10, 2019, he was spotted with a female companion.</p><h2>Quick Information</h2><table class=celeb_stats_table><tbody><tr class=row-fill><td>Net Worth:</td><td><strong>$4 Million</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Date of Birth:</td><td>Jun 27, 1987 (33 years old)</td></tr><tr><td>Gender:</td><td>Male</td></tr><tr><td>Height:</td><td>5 ft 8 in (1.75 m)</td></tr><tr><td>Profession:</td><td>Actor, Musician, Model</td></tr><tr><td>Nationality:</td><td>United Kingdom</td></tr></tbody></table>&nbsp; You may like:&nbsp;<a href=#>Brooks Nader</a> &nbsp; &nbsp;Thank you very much.<p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmion6XCra3Rp5ytr5%2Bnwal6wqikaJ2UYsSmv9OwoJyjXw%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fed-westwick.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fed-westwick.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fed-westwick.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fed-westwick.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fed-westwick.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fed-westwick.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./mary-tyler-moore-son-5107102.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./mary-tyler-moore-son-5107102.html>Find Out About Her Only Child, Richie Meeker Hollywood Life</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./who-is-josh-popper-boxing-instructor-5040415.html>Who Is Josh Popper? 5 Things on the Boxing Instructor Dating Madonna Hollywood Life</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./who-is-josh-popper-boxing-instructor-5040415.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
