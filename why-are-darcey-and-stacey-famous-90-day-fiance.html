The twin sisters are some of the biggest stars that have come out of this show. <a href=#>They even got their own spin-off, Darcey & Stacey, which is currently in its third season</a>. However, it has taken decades to get to this point in their lives. Not many fans know they've been trying to make it big for ages, so appearing on 90 Day Fiancé was by no means an accident.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Darcey and Stacey were unpopular when they were in school. The twin sisters had curly hair and thick glasses, and people would call them "the Troll dolls." Both stars said this was a challenging time in their lives, and it really affected their self-esteem. However, the obsession with fame came later on. More specifically, when they went to college. During that time, Darcey and Stacey worked as waitresses at Hooters. Ever since then, they never really had a real job. Here is the truth about 90 Day Fiancé stars Darcey and Stacey's rise to fame.</p><h2 id=did-darcey-and-stacey-fake-their-way-to-fame>Did Darcey And Stacey Fake Their Way To Fame?</h2><p>Darcey and Stacey had different "careers," but nothing took off, and their father, Mike Silva, just paid off for everything. Mike spent decades from the time the twin sisters were in college until Darcey ended up in 90 Day Fiancé funding their dreams of trying to get famous. As fans know, the twin sisters love to look super-rich, but not everything is as perfect as it seems.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Where Did TLC's Darcey And Stacey Get Their Money?</a></span></p><p>The 90 Day Fiancé stars have always loved to pretend they're rich and fancy, but in reality, their father has been bankrolling their lives. Mike is a successful and intelligent man, and some don't understand why he spoils her daughters so much. However, there might be an explanation. After <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Darcey and Stacey's brother, Michael, passed away tragically</a>, their father started taking more care of them because he missed his son so much.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Mike is on the show and has been behind the sisters with everything they've done financially. When fans google him, it says that he is the owner of a production company. However, that could not be further from the truth. In theory, he owns a production company, but its purpose was to make Darcey and Stacey famous. So, in reality, that's not where Mike makes his money at all.</p><h2 id=what-does-darcey-and-stacey-39-s-dad-do-for-a-living>What Does Darcey and Stacey's Dad Do For A Living?</h2><p><a href=#>Mike is the Chairman at Maison Worley Parsons</a>, China's largest international engineering procurement and construction management service provider. It's pretty clear that he's doing really well for himself from his job, more than likely not from the production company. Nevertheless, Darcey said on the show that their father usually spends a ton of time in China, like most of the year, and has been this way for the last 20 plus years.</p><p>It seems like a lot of Mike's life is actually in China since he has a fiancé there, and he usually only visits the girls during the holidays. But technically, he has been over in the United States for quite a while because of the pandemic. On the other hand, he is retiring soon, so he'll probably be able to spend more time with everyone.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>How Much Does TLC Pay Darcey And Stacey Per Episode?</a></span></p><p>Maybe that's another reason Mike has been spending so much money on Darcey and Stacey. It seems like he's always been a bit absent from their lives, even when they were younger. Fans think this is why he's always been so willing to fund everything the twins wanted to do.</p><h2 id=darcey-and-stacey-have-always-been-desperate-for-fame>Darcey And Stacey Have Always Been Desperate For Fame</h2><p>Darcey and Stacey have done a lot of different things. For example, <a href=#>they have their own clothing brand called House of Eleven by Silva Twins</a>, and they did not stop after trying to break into fashion. As proof of it, 90 Day Fiancé was not their first attempt at reality TV fame.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Before their TLC show, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the sisters also tried to create their own reality TV show called </a><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Twin Life</a>, and it was supposed to be a show about all of them in their day-to-day lives as twins with their then husbands and their kids. However, the pilot never made it to TV, and once again, Mike paid for everything. On the show, he plays the role of a man who's pretty straightforward with his daughters, and he gives them relationship and business advice.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Darcey and Stacey have tried everything to succeed. They tried fashion, reality TV, and even attempted to have singing careers. The twin sisters recorded a song called Lock Your Number, but they didn't continue pursuing their music careers. They also did some backing vocals in a movie called White T that their production company produced. There's no doubt that Darcey and Stacey were desperate to try anything to become famous. Nowadays, the twin sisters are doing their best to be more independent, but at the moment, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">their father keeps paying for everything, including their new house</a>.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>Who Are Darcey And Stacey's Exes (And Their Kids' Fathers)?</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuobFdlr%2BmecOaqZydqWKur7CMrKuam5WueqetzKisrGVpZXqlrdhmnaKZnpiycA%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwhy-are-darcey-and-stacey-famous-90-day-fiance.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fwhy-are-darcey-and-stacey-famous-90-day-fiance.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fwhy-are-darcey-and-stacey-famous-90-day-fiance.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fwhy-are-darcey-and-stacey-famous-90-day-fiance.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwhy-are-darcey-and-stacey-famous-90-day-fiance.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwhy-are-darcey-and-stacey-famous-90-day-fiance.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./dave-chappelle-chicago-no-phones-390498.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./dave-chappelle-chicago-no-phones-390498.html>You Can Go See Dave Chappelle in Chicago, But You Can't Use Your Phone</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./rick-ross-pay-11000-monthly-child-support-1234630200.html>Rick Ross Agrees To Pay $11,000 In Monthly Child Support</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./rick-ross-pay-11000-monthly-child-support-1234630200.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
