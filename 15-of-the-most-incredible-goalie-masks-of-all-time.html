Plante was not wearing a mask, which was very common and normal back then. After being stitched up and refusing to play without a mask, Plante returned to the ice, wearing a face hugging mask. This would prove to be a very important moment in hockey history, even though&nbsp;at the time, Plante was actually laughed at for wearing the mask. Many questioned his dedication and his fearlessness. However, as time went on, the goalie mask became accepted and eventually mandatory. Two things goalies realized about the mask, first was the most obvious in that it protected their face and improved their play. Second and most important, they realized they could put some awesome, cool and badass designs on it. Here is a look at 15 of the most incredible hockey goalie masks of all time.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=15-steve-valiquette---spider-man>15)&nbsp;Steve Valiquette - Spider-Man</h2><p>via:www.sportscardforum.com</p><p>Steve Valiquette is a crime fighter known as Spider-Man…er…was a goalie for the New York Rangers.

He has played for several teams including, the Chicago Blackhawks, San Jose Sharks, Toronto Maple Leafs and the Florida Panthers. His goalie mask would feature an eagle on every team he played for.

Imagine, skating down the ice with everything a player has left, only to look up and see the eyes of Ken Dryden peering back through that expressionless and terrifying mask. Despite being considered one of the all time great goaltenders, he actually had a short career, playing seven seasons. He won several Stanley Cups with the Montreal Canadians and in his first year, 1971, he won the Conn Smythe Trophy for Most Valuable Player.</p><p></p><h2 id=11-henrik-lundqvist---statue-of-liberty>11)&nbsp;Henrik Lundqvist&nbsp;- Statue Of Liberty</h2><p>tenderslounge.com</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a title="Henrik Lundqvist Net Worth" href=#>Henrik Lundqvist</a>&nbsp; is a Swedish hockey player who plays for the New York Rangers.
