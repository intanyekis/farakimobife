For former WWE Superstar , it was the opposite. He recently shared some insights about Vince McMahon.</p><p>Recently, <a href=#>the former Retribution membe</a>r was <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">interviewed by Denise Salcedo</a>. During the interview Mace shared what he thought about the fact that Vince McMahon is no longer the head of creative.</p><p>“I never thought it was possible. The past couple of years, every time I talk to my co-workers I’d be like, ‘Wow! We are actually living in the strangest times in the history of pro wrestling.’ Because, what has it been? For the past 30, 40 years, WWE has only been WWE under Vince McMahon. And for it to have even hinted that somebody else was making decisions was completely bizarre. Completely unfounded. And the guys who had been here for 10, 15 years, the locker room veterans at the time. You could just tell it was just, ‘Oh! This is so different.’ Because we are beholden to different Masters at this point. So… Change is Good. Change is great. But, it was definitely something different. Definitely something to get used to. And everybody as trying to figure it out at the same time.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><h2 id=h-mace-shares-an-interesting-tale-about-vince-mcmahon>Mace shares an interesting tale about Vince McMahon</h2><p>While staying on the topic of <a href=#>Vince McMahon</a>, the former Maximum Male Model also shared a never-before-told story about the former Chairman of WWE.</p><p>“Okay, here’s my favorite one. Before I was even wrestling for him, it was when I ended up on commentary. I’m in a production meeting and it’s my first production meeting ever. And because this is my first production meeting, I want to make a good impression. If you’re in college right? Or if you’re in school, you want to sit in that front ’T’ in the rows looking towards the teacher. So I sat myself in the back but in the middle. Very strategically, I didn’t want to take anybody’s seats. But I wanted to be seen and noticed taking notes in my little notebook. And I’m sitting there with my little notebook and everybody kind of just gets quiet. Because we’re all waiting for Vince to come from lunch.&nbsp;</p><p>“And he comes in. And I don’t know what’s happening. I’m like, ‘Do we rise like a judge is entering the courtroom or something? Nobody told me.’ He walks in. Silent. Steps in, takes a couple steps. I look at him, I acknowledge him and then I turn back my notebook to get ready for the meeting. And I just feel like [makes a loud thud noise] and he clubbed me in the back [laughs]. And then he takes two steps forward and he turns around and he goes, he looks like, if you’ve ever Jim Carry’s Grinch movie… He turns around and looks at me [mimics the Grinch face and laughs].</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><h2>Mace wondered if Vince McMahon would have booked him to beat up Brock Lesnar</h2><p>Mace wondered if he had reacting in a different way than how he actually did, if McMahon would have put him over in the brawl against Brock Lesnar.</p><p>“And I was like, ‘What do I do?’ In my head I’m like, ‘Was I in the way? Did I do something wrong? Was I…’ He’s like a strange Goblin man, like a strange Trickster. And my biggest regret was that, in that moment, I was like, ‘Man, if I would have taken a calculated risk and double-legged him and just started beating him up, I wonder if he would have made me beat Brock Lesnar instead of getting put through the table.’</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><h2>Mace claims there’s nothing that could prepare someone for working in WWE</h2><p>Mace also shared another story about Vince McMahon sneezing. He also claimed that the WWE work environment is a Cartoon Clown World but in the end, it is fun.</p><p>“In the same meeting, he sits down and he’s eating a very expensive steak. Blood Red Rare with ketchup. He’s eating it. It’s very quiet. We are all watching him eat this steak. And he sneezes, and he goes, ‘Dammit man. Control yourself.’ We are all sitting there and we’re like, ‘What is…? What’s going on?’ There’s nothing that could prepare you for working in that environment. It is Cartoon Clown World. And we’re all living in it. But, it’s fun,” Mace said.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7uL7ErKulnaqku6Z6wqikaKaVrMBwfZNsaG5xZmK6oq%2FEZqWerpWnerW0zq6eoaxdnsFuw8CsZKmno6i2o7jEZp2oql2sxKZ506hkp6ekYq%2BmedSnm56qXZi8r8DRqKNmp5Ziw6q6wp5kppudlrWwug%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2f1431596-mace-never-thought-it-was-possible-for-wwe-to-not-be-under-control-of-vince-mcmahon.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2f1431596-mace-never-thought-it-was-possible-for-wwe-to-not-be-under-control-of-vince-mcmahon.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2f1431596-mace-never-thought-it-was-possible-for-wwe-to-not-be-under-control-of-vince-mcmahon.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2f1431596-mace-never-thought-it-was-possible-for-wwe-to-not-be-under-control-of-vince-mcmahon.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2f1431596-mace-never-thought-it-was-possible-for-wwe-to-not-be-under-control-of-vince-mcmahon.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2f1431596-mace-never-thought-it-was-possible-for-wwe-to-not-be-under-control-of-vince-mcmahon.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./olivia-newton-john-cancer-battle-tragic-family-tragedy-father-death.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./olivia-newton-john-cancer-battle-tragic-family-tragedy-father-death.html>Olivia Newton-John's Heroic Cancer Battle Is Even More Inspiring Due To A Tragic Family Tragedy</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./kourtney-kardashian-swears-by-schmidts-natural-deodorant-w508591.html>Kourtney Kardashian Swears By Schmidts Natural Deodorant</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./kourtney-kardashian-swears-by-schmidts-natural-deodorant-w508591.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
