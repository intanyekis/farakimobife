While regular people go to&nbsp;work and wait on weekly paychecks, some of the most successful rappers are making hundreds of thousands of dollars for just performing a few shows. It sounds unfair, but that's the way of the world. So where do these rappers spend all their money? Well, it's the usual stuff: nice cars, jewelry, expensive clothes, night clubs and of course, some of the most lavish and spacious mansions you'll ever see in your life. In this feature, we bring you ten rappers, including Snoop Dogg, Young Jeezy, T.I. and LL Cool J, who are truly living in the lap of luxury. Check it out below:</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=10-2-chainz><strong>10. 2 Chainz</strong></h2><p>It might have taken a little bit for rapper&nbsp;<a href=#>2 Chainz </a>&nbsp;to get his career cooking, but now, it’s fair to say that the Atlanta rapper is one of the top names in the rap game. He has appeared on tracks with so many of&nbsp;hip-hop’s elite including: T.I., Rick Ross, The Game, Kendrick Lamar, Tech-N9ne and more. He’s getting paid really well too. In 2011, he bought a mansion in Palmetto, GA worth $517,000. It sits on 22 acres of land and boasts several bedrooms, an outdoor oven, built in to the patio and a fountain in the foyer. Mr. Chainz is living the life.</p><p></p><h2 id=9-snoop-dogg><strong>9. Snoop Dogg</strong></h2><p>At the age of 43, <a href=#>Snoop Dogg</a> is a certified icon in the rap game. Ever since he was discovered by <a href=#>Dr. Dre</a> in the early '90s, his career has continued to blossom, and now, he’s definitely interwoven into the fabric of American pop culture. With regards to his mansion, Snoop owns a beautiful home in Claremont, California. It was originally 3,700 square feet, but he expanded it to 6,500 square feet. It features beautiful high ceilings, five and a half bathrooms, a basketball court, recording studio and a movie theater. Now that’s what you call real baller status.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=8-ll-cool-j><strong>8. LL Cool J</strong></h2><p>At the age of 47, the rapper named <a href=#>LL Cool J</a> is also another pioneering forefather of the hip-hop industry. He’s originally from Queens, NYC, but these days, he earns most of his money in Hollywood acting in movies and starring on successful television dramas like NCIS: Los Angeles. LL Cool J has done very well for himself and he owns a 5,000 sq. ft. home in Manhasset, New York. The estate has six bedrooms, a gym, three bathrooms and get this; it even has a hair salon for his daughters. It must be very nice indeed.</p><p></p><h2 id=7-young-jeezy><strong>7. Young Jeezy</strong></h2><p>When you’re talking about the successful gangster rappers of the modern era, you definitely have to mention the Atlanta boss, <a href=#>Jeezy</a>. He has been inspiration to so many young rappers including <a href=#>Kendrick Lamar</a> and the entire TDE crew. At the beginning of this year, Jeezy upgraded his living conditions by purchasing an opulent $1.5 million mansion in Georgia. It’s a 9,000 sq. ft. home and it boasts 6 bedrooms and 7 bathrooms in addition to several roomy, living spaces. The plush mansion occupies a sprawling 1.2 acres of land and is&nbsp;guarded by immense 600 lbs cast iron front doors. Not bad at all.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=6-t-i><strong>6. T.I.</strong></h2><p>The Atlanta rapper <a href=#>T.I.</a> is a really successful hip-hop artist. He’s also very multifaceted – he produces, acts in movies, has his own fashion brand and also manages his own record label. He has a reported net worth of $75 million and he recently rented a fully furnished, ranch-style mansion in Buckhead, Atlanta. It features a lovely pool, four large bedrooms with en suite bathrooms, gourmet kitchen with custom cabinetry and a large dining room that can host up to 20 people. The rent for this palace is a substantial $12,000 a month.</p><p></p><h2 id=5-diddy><strong>5. Diddy&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>For those who are not familiar, the Hamptons in New York make up one of the most affluent neighborhoods in the United States. It’s where several of the major business titans and moguls of the East Coast have their holiday homes. It also happens to be the location for one of <a href=#>P.Diddy</a>’s many abodes. His Hamptons mansion is sleek and very stylish, and it’s usually where he hosts his “all-white” July 4th parties. It comes complete with a large swimming pool and several entertainment areas for all the parties and get-togethers he throws. When it comes to partying hard, no one does it quite like Diddy.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=4-rev-run><strong>4. Rev Run</strong></h2><p><a href=#>Rev Run</a> is a founding member of the iconic rap group Run DMC, one of the first mainstream rap groups in history. In his post-rapping career, Rev Run and his large family have been constant fixtures on the reality television circuit with shows like Run’s House, Rev Run’s Renovation and even a new show that’s airing on the cooking channel. His lavish mansion in New Jersey has been a permanent fixture on his shows. It’s a 9,000 square foot mansion and has six bedrooms, a lagoon style pool, a basketball court and even a recording studio. For a family with as many members as his, it’s a fitting manor for the illustrious Rev Run.</p><p></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=3-fat-joe><strong>3. Fat Joe</strong></h2><p>At one point in time, the rapper <a href=#>Fat Joe</a> was one of the biggest names in the game, but those times have past. These days, he has been in the news for tax evasion and serious issues with the IRS. Before all the problems started, the Bronx rapper moved to Miami and set himself up in an impressive mansion in Plantation, Florida. The property is worth close to $2 million and features 4 bedrooms, 3.5 bathrooms and even an additional guest house. It occupies 5,342 sq. ft. and a fully-equipped home theater. Most recently, he has had to sell this lovely home, but hey, nothing lasts forever.</p><p></p><h2 id=2-ludacris><strong>2. Ludacris</strong></h2><p>In the first part of <a href=#>insane rapper mansions</a>, we featured the sleek Los Angeles abode of Atlanta rapper/actor, <a href=#>Ludacris</a>. This time around, we are showing you his ridiculous mansion in his home town of Atlanta, Georgia. It’s amazing how much land you can get for a mansion in Georgia versus a city like New York. Luda purchased his mansion for $3 million and it includes a tennis court, basketball court, a man-made lake and several swimming pools. It must feel absolutely amazing to come home from tour to a plush estate like this.</p><p></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=1-rick-ross><strong>1. Rick Ross</strong></h2><p>In the first edition of insane rapper’s mansions, we featured the amazing Atlanta mansion owned by <a href=#>Rick Ross</a> which was originally the property of boxing champion Evander Holyfield. Now we are going to show you the Miami mansion he calls home. Rick Ross is a Florida native, and his mansion is located in the opulent suburb of Miami called Davie. It features sprawling grounds, a custom swimming pool, an all-gold master bedroom sink and a luxurious kitchen and custom&nbsp;cabinets. He has even featured his home in a couple of his music videos. It’s a fine mansion indeed.</p><p>Source Links:&nbsp;<a href=#>celebhomes.net</a>,&nbsp;<a href=#>frontdoor.com</a>, <a href=#>complex.com</a>, <a href=#>tmz.com</a></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmnrCgmru0tdWeZKWhlprAtcXLnmZqaF2ntqW1wq6jqK2jYr%2BivM%2BeqWalkaPAqrvNrGSpmaKpenN7</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2f10-ridiculous-rapper-mansions-part-2.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2f10-ridiculous-rapper-mansions-part-2.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2f10-ridiculous-rapper-mansions-part-2.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2f10-ridiculous-rapper-mansions-part-2.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2f10-ridiculous-rapper-mansions-part-2.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2f10-ridiculous-rapper-mansions-part-2.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./tiger-king-conspiracy-theory-jeff-lowe-carole-baskin-husband.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./tiger-king-conspiracy-theory-jeff-lowe-carole-baskin-husband.html>Crazy Tiger King Conspiracy Suggests Jeff Lowe Was Once Married To Carole Baskin</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./shakira-pregnant-lewis-hamilton-baby-rumors-weight-gain-baby-bump.html>Weight Gain Baby Bump The Talks Today</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./shakira-pregnant-lewis-hamilton-baby-rumors-weight-gain-baby-bump.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
