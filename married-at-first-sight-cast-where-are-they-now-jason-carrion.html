Despite that fact, it is very clear that there have been very few “reality” shows that have been on the same level as<strong> <a href=#>Married at First Sight</a></strong> in terms of craziness. Of course, arranged marriages have been a major part of human history but the idea of having complete strangers pick out your spouse is wild, even if they are so-called experts.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>10 Red Flags From Season 13 Of ‘Married At First Sight’ (So Far)</a></span></p><p>Unfortunately, the fact of the matter is that the vast majority of <a href=#>Married at First Sight couples have broken up</a>. With that in mind, it is even harder to believe that anyone signs up to be a part of the show anymore especially since <a href=#>Married at First Sight stars don’t get paid a fortune</a>. However, the really wild thing is that one of the people who starred in the first season of Married at First Sight actually went on to have an even crazier life after leaving the show behind.</p><h2 id=jason-carrion-and-courtney-hendrix-39-s-marriage-didn-rsquo-t-last>Jason Carrion And Courtney Hendrix's Marriage Didn’t Last</h2><p>During the first season of Married at First Sight, Courtney Hendrix and Jason Carrion got married after meeting each other for the first time at the altar. Of course, it should go without saying that the process of getting to know each other wasn’t always easy for the duo. Despite that, Hendrix and Carrion truly seemed like they grew to care very deeply about each other and they decided to stay together at the end of the season.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>After the first season of Married at First Sight aired, many viewers were very invested in Jason Carrion and Courtney Hendrix’s relationship. Ultimately, in 2019 it was announced that Carrion and Hendrix’s marriage of five years was ending in divorce. That same year, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Carrion gave a statement to People about the divorce</a>.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Married At First Sight Couples Break Up Amid Rumors The Show Is Utterly Fake</a></span></p><p>“It is with a heart full of sadness that me and Cortney have decided to separate. We fell deeply in love, and had very much a fairytale story being married as complete strangers in the docu-series, Married at First Sight. We both had such an incredibly magical journey together these past few years, making this that much harder to write and even harder to live.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=how-jason-carrion-rsquo-s-life-got-even-crazier-after-married-at-first-sight>How Jason Carrion’s Life Got Even Crazier After Married At First Sight</h2><p>After the first season of Married at First Sight aired and became a hit, the decision was made to extend the franchise by airing a spin-off titled Married at First Sight: The First Year. As a result of that spin-off, viewers found out that one of the biggest issues in Jason Carrion and Courtney Hendrix’s marriage was his busy schedule. After all, not being able to spend much time with your new spouse would cause tensions in any marriage.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Married At First Sight: Ranking The Most Toxic Couples So Far</a></span></p><p>At the same time that Jason Carrion was pursuing a career as a firefighter, he also was indulging his passion for his other job which was performing as a professional wrestler. While it was unfortunate that Carrion and Hendrix’s marriage didn’t work out, their 2019 divorce definitely freed up his schedule. As a result, it makes sense that Carrion performed in 19 wrestling matches that year. On top of that, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Carrion became the LDN World Champion</a> in 2019.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Of course, a lot of people consider being a pro wrestler to be crazy enough, However, when it comes to Jason Carrion’s professional wrestling career, fate had something crazy in store. After all, the year after Carrion’s marriage to Courtney Hendrix ended, the COVID-19 pandemic took the world by storm and put most professional wrestling shows on hiatus.</p><p>The same year that a pandemic put Jason Carrion’s wrestling career on hold, his life took another major twist that caught many observers by surprise. After all, the former Married at First Sight star walked down the aisle a second time, only a year after his divorce. The following year in 2021, it was announced that Carrion’s new wife was carrying his baby. If that wasn’t crazy enough, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Carrion married a woman named Roxanne Pallett</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While the name Roxanne Pallett may not be familiar to most people in North America, she is much more famous than her husband in her homeland. After all, Pallett starred in the British soap opera Emmerdale for years. On top of that, Pallett starred in a season of the U.K.’s Celebrity Big Brother and she falsely accused a male housemate of purposefully striking her multiple times while intending to hurt her. To say that viewers were outraged is a massive understatement and Pallett once labeled herself “the most hated girl in Britain”. After leaving the Big Brother house, Pallett took part in many interviews in which she apologized profusely for the incident.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGikmqqinrKlecCtZJ%2BhoqjBbr%2FIoJ%2BtZZOWwLV51qGcq51dlr%2BmedOhnLJlnqTEbrbArKanZZOWv7O1zqdm</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fmarried-at-first-sight-cast-where-are-they-now-jason-carrion.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fmarried-at-first-sight-cast-where-are-they-now-jason-carrion.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fmarried-at-first-sight-cast-where-are-they-now-jason-carrion.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fmarried-at-first-sight-cast-where-are-they-now-jason-carrion.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fmarried-at-first-sight-cast-where-are-they-now-jason-carrion.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fmarried-at-first-sight-cast-where-are-they-now-jason-carrion.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./top-15-biggest-tips-ever-left-by-celebrities.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./top-15-biggest-tips-ever-left-by-celebrities.html>Top 15 Biggest Tips Ever Left By Celebrities</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./last-2-lowes-foods-stores-gastonia-close.html>Last 2 Lowes Foods stores in Gastonia to close WSOC TV</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./last-2-lowes-foods-stores-gastonia-close.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
