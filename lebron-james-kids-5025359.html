Off the court, LeBron is such a<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link> loving dad to his three children</a> (<strong>Bronny</strong>, <strong>Bryce,&nbsp;</strong>and&nbsp;<strong>Zhuri</strong>), who he shares with his wife&nbsp;<strong><a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Savannah</a></strong>.</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>In July 2023, Bronny, 18, “<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>suffered a cardiac arrest</a>,” while practicing, according to a statement from the James family.&nbsp; “Medical staff was able to treat Bronny and take him to the hospital.&nbsp; He is now in stable condition and no longer in ICU.&nbsp; We ask for respect and privacy for the James family, and we will update the media when there is more information.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>On July 27, 2023, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Beverly Hills issued a release stating that Bronny was discharged. “Thanks to the swift and effective response by the USC athletics’ medical staff, Bronny James was successfully treated for a sudden cardiac arrest,” the <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>release read</a>. “He arrived at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center fully conscious, neurologically intact and stable.

Bronny has clearly taken after his dad and is an incredibly skilled basketball player himself. He’s currently only a high school star, but it seems incredibly likely that he’ll also follow his dad into the NBA.</p><p id=content-paragraph-8>Of course, having your dad be the GOAT can only help your basketball skills, and LeBron has <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>regularly trained</a> with his sons to help them get better at the game. Bronny opened up about following in his dad’s footsteps in a 2022 profile in&nbsp;<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Sports Illustrated</a>.&nbsp;“I was born into it, so I feel like the path was already chosen,” he said. “My dad is cool enough to let me take whatever path I want if I wanted to not pursue basketball. But I think basketball is going to be my thing, for sure.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-9>Bronny has been attracting attention from recruiters since he was a kid, and colleges tried to offer him scholarships from as young as 11, per <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>ESPN</a>. For his <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>senior year,</a> Bronny was named a “McDonald’s All-American” player in 2023, which is 20 years after his dad received the same recognition. He also revealed his hopes to <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>play in the NBA</a> in the aforementioned&nbsp;S.I.&nbsp;profile, and LeBron has been very public in saying that he wants to get a chance to play in the league with his son in numerous interviews and on <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Twitter</a>.</p><p id=content-paragraph-10>On Saturday, May 6, Bronny made the announcement that he committed to the University of Southern California for basketball via his <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Instagram account</a>. “Fight On…#committed,” he wrote in a caption of a photo of himself standing in a USC dressing room wearing his high school jersey from Sierra Canyon.</p><p id=content-paragraph-11>Dad LeBron was <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>“so proud” of his son for committing</a>. “[It’s] one of the best days of my life,” LeBron said to a reporter after an NBA Championship game against the Golden State Warriors on May 6. “First of all, congratulations on Bronny and the decision he made…super proud of him…our family is proud of him,” he went on.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>"One of the best days of my life… Super proud of him… It's even more special to me cause it's the first time someone out of my family to go to college… No matter the outcome of this game, I couldn't lose today."</p><p id=content-paragraph-12>LeBron James on Bronny committing to USC<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>pic.twitter.com/9G3LEaZWGi</a></p><p id=content-paragraph-13>— ClutchPoints (@ClutchPoints) <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>May 7, 2023</a></p><p id=content-paragraph-15>However, Bronny’s basketball future was questionable after the 18-year-old suffered a cardiac arrest during a USC workout. “Medical staff was able to treat Bronny and take him to the hospital,” read a statement from his family. “He is now in stable condition and no longer in ICU.&nbsp; We ask for respect and privacy for the James family, and we will update the media when there is more information.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-16>“LeBron and Savannah wish to publicly send their deepest thanks and appreciation to the USC medical and athletic staff for their incredible work and dedication to the safety of their athletes,” the statement concluded. As mentioned above, on July 27, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center issued a statement indicating that Bronny had been released from the hospital.</p><h2>Bryce Maximus James</h2><p id=content-paragraph-17>LeBron and <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Savannah</a> had their second son <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Bryce</a>, 15, in 2007. Like his brother, Bryce has also followed in his dad’s footsteps and found a<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link> love of basketball himself</a>. While he has a few more years before he starts preparing for college (or the pros), Bryce has shown that he’s also got skills on the court, like when his dad shared a <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>viral video</a> of him dunking with one hand in February 2023.</p><p id=content-paragraph-18>While LeBron has shown his dreams of playing with his kids, by the time Bryce would be eligible for the league, the Lakers star will have already played for well over 20 years, but he said that he’s keeping the idea open when speaking to&nbsp;Sports Illustrated.&nbsp;“I feel like I could play for quite a while. So it’s all up to my body, but more importantly, my mind. If my mind can stay sharp and fresh and motivated, then the sky’s not even a limit for me. I can go beyond that. But we shall see,” LeBron said.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Let’s get it <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>pic.twitter.com/xstwYIaAxN</a></p><p id=content-paragraph-19>— Bryce James (@bryce_james23) <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>August 10, 2023</a></p><p id=content-paragraph-21><span>Bryce confirmed his commitment to play for&nbsp;</span>Notre Dame High School in Sherman Oaks, California via Twitter on August 11, 2023.&nbsp;“Let’s get it,” the <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>16-year-old posted</a>, wearing a uniform. The move comes after he was reported to play at Campbell Hall — also the alma matter of <strong>Mary Kate</strong> and <strong>Ashley Olsen</strong> — from his previous school Sierra Canyon, but changed his mind. At Notre Dame, Bryce will also play with <strong>Master P</strong>‘s son <strong>Mercy Miller</strong>.</p><h2>Zhuri Nova James</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/lebron-james-kids-splash-embed-2.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-22>Savannah gave birth to her and LeBron’s only <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>daughter</a> Zhuri, 8, in 2014, a year after they tied the knot. While time may tell and things can change, Zhuri’s parents told&nbsp;S.I. she hasn’t been as interested in playing basketball as her brothers. Still, LeBron has posted sweet photos of his daughter<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link> joining him for workouts</a> and they’ve posed together at events like the&nbsp;<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Space Jam 2&nbsp;premiere</a>. While it’s not clear if someday she’ll play basketball, LeBron has showed that his daughter has taken an interest in <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>dancing</a> in<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link> cute Instagram videos.&nbsp;</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGidnpmkqr%2Bme8uemaunnmK3ornErGSkoZSoenZ8kW5qbnFf</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2flebron-james-kids-5025359.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2flebron-james-kids-5025359.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2flebron-james-kids-5025359.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2flebron-james-kids-5025359.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2flebron-james-kids-5025359.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2flebron-james-kids-5025359.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./brandon-staley-wife.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./brandon-staley-wife.html>Brandon Staley Wife Amy Ward, Children, Parents, Family, Age, Height, Salary, Net Worth</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./what-is-the-most-heart-breaking-thing-involving-a-top-chef-competitior-that-happened.html>What is the most heart breaking thing that happened involving a Top Chef competitior?</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./what-is-the-most-heart-breaking-thing-involving-a-top-chef-competitior-that-happened.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
