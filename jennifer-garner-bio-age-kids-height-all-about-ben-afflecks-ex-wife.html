<time>03 Jun 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p>Jennifer Garner is an American business woman, farmer, activist, and actress, who has featured in a lot of very successful movies over the years in Hollywood. She is a household name in America and around the world having starred in successful movies such as Juno, Daredevil, Valentine’s Day, Charlotte’s Web, The Kingdom and a host of other movies.</p><p>She is also Ben Affleck’s ex-wife and mother of their three children. She is a celebrity ambassador for a charity organization called Save the Children – which was set up to promote early child education, national literacy and healthy nutrition. She has always been in the habit of supporting several other organizations that are in their own way trying to make the world a much better place for us all.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=jennifer-garners-biography-age></span><strong>Jennifer Garner’s Biography & Age</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Jennifer Anne Garner was born in Houston, Texas in the United States of America to the Garner family on April 17, 1972. Her father, Bill Garner was a Chemical Engineer working with Union Carbide, while her mother, Patricia Anne, was a home maker, who later became an English teacher at a local college near their home. She grew up with two other siblings – an older sister, Melissa Lynn Garner and younger sister, Susannah Kay Garner.</p><p>When Jennifer was three, her family moved from Houston, Texas to Charleston, West Virginia where they settled down. The Garners are devoted Christians, who attended a United Methodist Church in their locality and took active part in Vacation Bible School. Jennifer remembers that while she and her sisters were growing up, they were not allowed to paint their nails, put on makeup, dye their hair or pierce any parts of their body. Getting a tattoo was a taboo in the Garner household and none of the Garner girls have any today.</p><p>Jennifer Garner attended George Washington High School in Charleston, West Virginia before getting admission into Denison University, Granville, Ohio to study Chemistry, just like her father. After a year in the University, she changed from studying Chemistry to Theater, and graduated in 1994 with a Bachelor of Fine Arts degree in Theater Performance.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=relationships-marriage-and-kids></span><strong>Relationships, Marriage And Kids</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Jennifer’s first shot at marriage was to fellow actor and co-star on Felicity, Scott Foley. Jennifer and Scott met while starring on the television drama series Felicity, and their love connection on set was transposed to real life, as they began dating in 1998. Two years later they got married right in their home on October 19, 2000. While married, everything seemed to be going very well until cracks began to show in their relationship and they separated from each other in March 2003. They eventually filed for divorce in May 2003, citing irreconcilable differences as the reason for the split of their marriage.</p><p>While she was separated from her husband, Jennifer began dating another actor, Michael Vartan, who was her co-star on the television show Alias,&nbsp;between mid 2003 and mid 2004.</p><p>Shortly after Jennifer Garner broke off from her relationship with her boyfriend, Michael, she started dating fellow actor and Batman actor, Ben Affleck. Her romance with Affleck started in 2004, and was a product of a cordial relationship that they had established earlier while on the set of the movies Pearl Harbor (2001) and Daredevil (2003). Less than a year after they began dating, the pair’s love grew very quickly and on June 29, 2005, they were joined in marriage in a private ceremony. Their wedding had just two other guests in attendance –&nbsp; the officiating minister and his husband.</p><p>The Afflecks had their first child together in 2005; Jennifer gave birth to their first daughter who was named Violet Affleck. Another daughter followed Violet; she was given birth to in 2009 and was named Seraphina Rose Affleck. Their third and final child, a son named Samuel Garner Affleck, was born in 2012.</p><p>In 2015, the relationship between Jennifer and her husband became estranged and they were separated. Jennifer eventually filed for divorce from her husband in 2017, but due to the fact that her husband was suffering from alcohol addiction and had checked into a rehabilitation facility, they both went through the divorce processes in a very civil manner. The two have joint custody of their three children, and they have been seen together after the divorce, having a nice time on family vacations.</p><p>After the dissolution of her second marriage, Jennifer decided not bow to the pressure of the media to get married again and has chosen to take her time before making the march to the altar again.</p><p>Jennifer Garner is currently dating John Miller, CEO and Chairman of CaliGroup. They are currently taking things not too serious, and are enjoying each other company a lot.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=jennifer-garners-net-worth></span><strong>Jennifer Garner’s Net Worth</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Jennifer is a very successful actress and her professionalism in her career has given her a fortune of $60 million.
