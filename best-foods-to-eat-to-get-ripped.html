It’s going to take some commitment and consistency, but if you hang in there for as little as just 3 weeks, you’re going to see results. And you know what they say about seeing results from your diet and/or physical activities; you become addicted and never want to stop.</p><h2>Benefits of Being Ripped</h2><p>Aside from the great looks you get from being ripped, there are other benefits to it. Health benefits that will help you lead a healthy lifestyle.</p><p>There are short term benefits like the following</p><ul><li>Gyming to develop muscles will improve your sleep. If you suffer sleeplessness, even after a very stressful day, try hitting the gym, even for as little as 20 minutes. That may be all the help you need to tackle your sleepless nights.</li><li>Eating healthy and working out at the same time will boost your confidence and mood almost immediately. It does this thing to your brain that makes it release endorphins enough to make you feel so good about yourself.</li><li>Improved metabolism is another benefit of living the ripped life. You get to burn fats, even when you’re at rest.</li></ul><p>There are also long term benefits that come with trying to develop muscles to look ripped</p><ul><li>As you get older, your bone functionality tends to decrease. In other words, you experience bone loss, and the little you have left will be fragile and prone to fractures. Gaining muscles is a great way to avoid this to a great extent, but you have to do that while you’re young.</li><li>Eating and working out to stay ripped can help you maintain a younger and exuberant personality. Have you seen any of those Instagram images of a 70-year-old grandma or grandpa in the gym looking like they are 55?</li><li>Age-related health conditions like heart diseases, hypertension, mental issues, etc. can be better controlled if you’re into the “ripped life.”</li></ul><h2>10 Foods to Eat to Get Ripped</h2><p>Note that it is quite unrealistic if you expect to get ripped by just eating these meals. The foods alone cannot do much for you in this case, but they can help you develop muscles faster than usual if you combine them with efficient physical activities. So make sure that you put yourself on the field and work harder combined with a healthy diet.</p><p>Another point worthy of note is to eat as many protein-rich foods as possible. Protein will help in the formation of new cell tissues resulting in faster muscle gain. Carbohydrates and fats are also important to help you boost energy. Without further due, here are the best food items to eat if you want to get ripped.</p><h3>Salmon</h3><p></p><p>Salmon is one of the great sources of protein there is. They contain very important nutrients and minerals as well as they play an important role in muscle and overall health.</p><p>In addition to its health benefits, salmons are rich in <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>omega-3 fatty acids</a> which help in muscle development.</p><h3>Eggs</h3><p></p><p>Eggs have a little bit of everything. It is good for your general health and it is one food that will help you build muscles seamlessly. A single egg contains about 6 grams of high-quality protein, and that’s like one of the highest (if not the highest) standards of measuring other foods’ protein contents.</p><p>At least 2 eggs per day are enough to set you on the right path to being ripped. You can choose to boil, fry, or scramble them. Whatever works for you basically. But it is recommended that you consume boiled eggs to leverage the maximum nutritious value from it.</p><h3>Almonds</h3><p></p><p>Muscle builders looking for a quality nutritious source to help them develop and maintain a ripped body can count on almonds to help them out (amidst other foods obviously). They contain many vital nutrients that are helpful in muscle building like protein, unsaturated fats, vitamins, etc.</p><p>The lipid components of almonds are good for cell development, and the protein helps to increase the muscle mass.</p><h3>Cottage Cheese</h3><p></p><p>Cottage cheese does not quite fit into this list, but you’re going to be surprised at what it can do to help you get a ripped body. It has more than 25 grams of protein in one cup of it. And it is not just any type of protein. Cottage cheese contains a slow digesting casein protein which has amino acids. These amino acids take quite a while to digest, and as such, provides your body with a steady supply of muscle building fuel.</p><h3>Chicken Breast</h3><p></p><p>Except you’re new to the whole muscle diet thing, it should come as no surprise to you that <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>chicken breast can help you gain weight</a>. It has a lot of protein; 26 grams in every 85 grams of chicken; and it has a lot of vitamins too.</p><p>The <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>B vitamins</a> niacin and B6 contents in chicken breast play notable roles in muscles development. They help you keep up with the stress that comes with physical activities while boosting muscle development at the same time</p><h3>Greek Yogurt</h3><p></p><p>Dairy products are great for muscle building, but some tend to work better than others. Greek yogurt, for instance, is 100% more nutritious than any other type of yogurt. Seeing as that is the case, it is safe to say that Greek yogurt can improve your rate of muscle building by at least 80% compared to other forms of yogurt.</p><p>It contains a mixture of fats and slow digesting proteins, which according to research, increases how much lean muscles you develop.</p><h3>Lean Beef</h3><p></p><p>Lean meat is like muscle building multivitamins. It is one of the most concentrated food sources of creatine, which is a potent anaerobic backup energy reserve in muscle cells. Lean beef has a lot of protein for sure, but it extends beyond that. Beef contains an impressive collection of the 9 essential amino acids and is easily digested and used by the body.</p><h3>Shrimp</h3><p></p><p>Shrimp is high in protein, <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>but low in calories</a>. It is the perfect addition to your diet plan and it will sure help you build some healthy muscles with time. Aside from its protein contents, <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>shrimp has a ton of potassium</a> and electrolyte which are vital for optimum performance in the gym.</p><h3>Soybean</h3><p></p><p>Soybean is rich in protein, healthy unsaturated fats, and a host of other nutrients. All of these nutrients play a vital role in achieving that ripped body you’re looking for (and maintaining it as well).</p><p>Iron, for instance, is used to transport oxygen to your blood and muscles in order to keep them healthy. A lack of iron will lead to weak muscles, and probably loss of muscle mass over time.</p><h3>Turkey Breast</h3><p></p><p>This is another good source of vitamins, protein, and minerals. All of these components help you gain greater muscle mass if you consume them consistently over a period of time. The B vitamin, niacin, helps to process fats and carbohydrates in your body, which boosts your energy. And the protein help to boost muscle development.</p><p>Note that these tips were well researched and will definitely produce results if you stick to them. To even make it more effective, you should try combining your diet plans with some form of physical activities; specifically, <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>weight lifting</a>.
