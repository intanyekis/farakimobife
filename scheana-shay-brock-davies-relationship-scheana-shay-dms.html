At the end of the day, poor choices can be a bone of contention. One such choice occurred when <strong>Brock messaged a <a href=#>Bachelor</a> star when he was engaged to Sheana</strong>.</p><p>Unlike Adriana Madox and Tom Sandoval who ended their <a href=#>relationship filled with a dramatic scandal </a>after Tom cheated, sparking rumors that<a href=#> Scandoval was for ratings purposes</a>, <strong>Brock and Scheana are not ready to end their marriage</strong>. But, there are still clearly issues that need to be worked on. As such, we will look at Brock Davies and Scheana Shay's rocky relationship that started after he slid into a Bachelor star's DM. Then why <strong>Scheana told Brock she did not see them together forever</strong> will be discussed, followed by <strong>where Scheana and Brock's relationship stands today</strong>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=brock-davies-slid-into-the-bachelor-39-s-shanae-ankney-39-s-dms-during-a-rocky-period-with-scheana-shay>Brock Davies Slid Into The Bachelor's Shanae Ankney's DMs During A Rocky Period With Scheana Shay</h2><p><strong>Brock and Scheana met in 2019</strong> and the two jumped into a relationship very quickly. They lived through the pandemic together, suffered through a miscarriage six months after becoming a couple, and by 2021, had a daughter together, dealt with <a href=#>Brock abandoning his kids with his ex-wife to pursue his career</a>, and were engaged.</p><p>While the couple claimed that the experiences made them closer, they also admitted to dealing with issues in their relationship. During a period when the couple was arguing over how to raise their daughter, Summer, <strong>they were constantly arguing</strong>. It was in this timeframe that Brock DM'd Bachelor star, Shanae Ankney.</p><span class=txt>Close</span> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Scheana admitted during a February 2022 episode of Scheananagins with Scheana, that <strong>Brock reached out to Shanae</strong> with a simple comment.</p><p>"You're making great TV."</p><p>Shanae responded to Brock and thanked him for the compliment. But, as Scheana explained, the conversation continued between the two. This was because, according to Scheana, Brock wanted Shanae to be part of his Homebody app he was trying to launch at the time.</p><p>While <strong>Scheana said that she was okay with Brock reaching out to Shanae</strong>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">fans were not so convinced</a>. Many wondered if Scheana was just jumping out before the story could become a scandal, especially with <strong>Brock having a history of flirting and texting other women when he was with his ex-wife</strong>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Others still questioned why Scheana and Brock's PR team was not reaching out to Shanae rather than Brock DMing her.</p><p>It was not until April 2022, that <strong>Scheana would admit that she and Brock were having problems</strong> on Scheananagins with Scheana. The problems, Scheana said, had to do with how to parent Summer. This was specifically dealing with "parenting and, like, sleep training and the things she eats."</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/vanderpump-rules-tom-sandoval-and-girlfriend-go-head-to-head-with-billie-lee-over-outlandish-comments.png> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="Vanderpump Rules' Tom Sandoval And Girlfriend Go Head To Head With Billie Lee Over Outlandish Comments">Vanderpump Rules' Tom Sandoval And Girlfriend Go Head To Head With Billie Lee Over Outlandish Comments</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>Vanderpump Rules star Tom Sandoval is defending himself after Billie Lee made shocking claims about his character and new girlfriend.</p><p>"It’s affecting our relationship. It’s affecting our sleep, which affects our mood."</p><p>It is unclear if Brock was messaging Shanae during one of their arguments about Summer. But, the timeline does not bode well for a happy relationship when in the throes of trying to parent when not on the same page about how to raise a child.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=scheana-shay-told-brock-davies-she-didn-39-t-see-them-together-forever>Scheana Shay Told Brock Davies She Didn't See Them Together Forever</h2><p>Despite getting<strong> individual therapy and trying couple's therapy</strong>, Scheana and Brock were still having problems with their relationship in 2023-2024. This, again, mainly had to do with the way Summer was being parented. It also had to do with the fact that <strong>Scheana was learning to deal with her postpartum obsessive-compulsive disorder.</strong> This made it so that Scheana would picture the worst of things happening to Summer when she was not in her care.</p><p>Because Scheana was always afraid something was going to happen to Summer, it made it so that she did not want to leave the house without her. As such, Scheana and Brock got very little time away from their daughter. This was frustrating for Brock, especially since they did have trusted people to watch Summer.</p><span class=txt>Close</span> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>One of the times that Brock and Scheana did step out for a night out was when they went to dinner for their one-year Cancun, Mexico wedding anniversary. It was during this time that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Scheana dropped a bombshell on Brock</a> that brought him to tears.</p><p>"I don't think you and I are going to be together forever."</p><p>While Scheana did go on to explain that she did not want to have thoughts like that, the way that the two were communicating with one another was taking a toll on their relationship.<strong> Scheana wanted to work on things and get their relationship on track, but needed Brock to meet her halfway.</strong></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/vanderpump-rules-producer-slammed-sheana-shay-s-remarks-on-the-show-s-manufactured-storylines.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="Vanderpump Rules' Producer Slammed Sheana Shay's Remarks On The Show's 'Manufactured Storylines'">Vanderpump Rules' Producer Slammed Sheana Shay's Remarks On The Show's 'Manufactured Storylines'</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>The Executive Producer of Vanderpump Rules has slammed Sheana Shay's comments about forced storylines in the Season 11 finale.</p><p>Scheana and Brock were able to get past their emotional conversation at dinner and appeared to be on the same page with their relationship. But even after laying all of their thoughts and fears out for one another to see, rumors still swirled that the relationship between Scheana and Brock was on thin ice.</p><h2 id=where-scheana-shay-and-brock-davies-39-relationship-stands-today>Where Scheana Shay And Brock Davies' Relationship Stands Today</h2><p>There is no denying that Scheana and Brock have been through quite a bit since getting together in 2019. But, this past year has been one of the most difficult for the two, as was seen during Season 11 of <a href=#>Vanderpump Rules</a>. While the two put on a good front for their friends and in front of the camera at times, there were problems bubbling below the surface and even momentary questioning if Brock and Raquel Leviss had anything going on in the wake of Scandoval.</p><p>Fortunately, according to Scheana, during an April 2024, Scheananagins with Scheana, the two are in a<strong> "much better place now."</strong></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <span class=txt>Close</span><p>Scheana admitted that she and Brock had gone through "a lot of issues" in 2023, which played out for audiences in 2024. While it was a "difficult time" in their relationship, Scheana feels like they have made it through a lot of the problems plaguing their marriage.</p><p>"I think that after everything we went through and have been in therapy about individually, I think we're in the best place we've ever been in."</p><p>Scheana noted that<strong> every relationship has its ups and downs</strong>. But it was through communicating with one another that Scheana and Brock were able to <strong>remember how much "love" and "respect" they had for one another</strong> and how much they wanted their marriage to work.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"We want our family to work."</p><p>As much as the couple thought that couple's therapy would be the answer for them, they were not able to find that it worked for them. Instead, they<strong> turned to getting their brain chemistry aligned</strong> which, as Scheana shared on the Jeff Lewis Has Issues podcast, was a game changer for the couple.</p><p>After getting their brain chemistry aligned via a supplement program prescribed by their psychiatrist and brain disorder specialist, Scheana and Brock were able to better communicate. This, and continuing their respective individual therapies, according to Scheana, has helped save their marriage.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/scheana-shay-1.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="The Future Of ‘Vanderpump Rules’ Remains Uncertain After A Producer Allegedly Threatened To Cancel It">The Future Of ‘Vanderpump Rules’ Remains Uncertain After A Producer Allegedly Threatened To Cancel It</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>Scheana Shay discusses the pressure put on her and the rest of the Vanderpump Rules cast after a producer claimed he would cancel the show.</p><p>What the future holds for Brock and Scheana is not certain.

While there are not any plans or pressure to have any other children soon, the couple is not closing the doors on expanding their family. For now, though, the family of three is content in the life they have built for themselves, that only appears to be getting stronger as time goes on.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/sharedimages/2024/04/vanderpump-rules-poster.jpg><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="Vanderpump Rules">Vanderpump Rules</a></h5>TV-14DramaReality <strong>Release Date</strong> <span>January 7, 2013</span> <strong>Creator(s)</strong> <span>Alex Baskin , Douglas Ross , Lisa Vanderpump</span> <strong>Cast</strong> <span>Scheana Shay , Lisa Vanderpump , Katie Maloney , Tom Sandoval , Tom Schwartz , Ariana Madix , James Kennedy , Lala Kent</span> <strong>Main Genre</strong> <span>Reality</span> <strong>Seasons</strong> <span>11</span> <strong>Writers</strong> <span>Alex Baskin , Douglas Ross , Lisa Vanderpump</span> <strong>Streaming Service(s)</strong> <span>Bravo , E! , Peacock</span> <strong>Franchise(s)</strong> <span>Vanderpump Rules</span> Expand<p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiqnKCVlruiedKhmLJlkqe8pLeMnZivoZWoerOxy5qroqeeqLWqvIysmqGdkaOubr%2FHmrBmnJ2ofA%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fscheana-shay-brock-davies-relationship-scheana-shay-dms.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fscheana-shay-brock-davies-relationship-scheana-shay-dms.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fscheana-shay-brock-davies-relationship-scheana-shay-dms.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fscheana-shay-brock-davies-relationship-scheana-shay-dms.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fscheana-shay-brock-davies-relationship-scheana-shay-dms.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fscheana-shay-brock-davies-relationship-scheana-shay-dms.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./the-pitbull-way-how-armando-christian-perez-became-a-global-sensation.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./the-pitbull-way-how-armando-christian-perez-became-a-global-sensation.html>The Pitbull Way: How Armando Christian Prez Became A Global Sensation</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./ryan-arey-net-worth.html>Ryan Arey Net Worth</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./ryan-arey-net-worth.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
