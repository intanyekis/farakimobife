In their defense, the strategy had worked in the past seasons. But instead of looking for new stars, the network plucked two of their best stars from Naked and Afraid, EJ Snyder and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jeff Zausch</a>. Both stars were well received and had made a name for themselves. On paper, things worked out perfectly. But in reality, nothing could be farther from the truth. The pair failed to find any chemistry and the series fell apart. In this article, we will take a closer look at the wiki bio of EJ Snyder.
