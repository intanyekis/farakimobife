She attended Lassiter High School where she graduated in 2011. She then proceeded to George Washington University where she earned a bachelor’s degree in Political Science. Westwood is also a graduate of the National Journalism Centre’s fellowship program. Although not much is known about her family, siblings, early childhood and parents; we do know that Sarah was a precocious teenager and was quite versed in political issues from a young age. Her interest will go on to shape her future career as a reporter and investigative journalist par excellence.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=career-achievements></span><strong>Career Achievements</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Westwood started off on her journalism career quite early. She began working as an editor for ViralRead; a blog dedicated to political news articles and stories. Westwood then worked as an intern for the Daily Journal. Shortly after her internship, she took up a job as an investigative journalist and reporter for the Washington Examiner in 2014. While there, Westwood spent much of her time covering critical political issues including fraud and abuse in government. In 2016, however, her duties soon shifted to “White House Correspondence” for the news agency.</p><p>As her profile increased, she became a resource person and occasionally revisits the National Journalism Centre to provide training and mentorship for her colleagues in training. Asides that, Sarah Westwood’s career has enabled her to appear in high-profile news programs and channels like MSNBC, CNN and Fox News. As of the time of writing, she works as a White House Correspondence for CNN. But there’s more to the young and talented journalist.</p><p>Her career has exposed her to several notable achievements. In 2015, she won the “Robert Novak Journalism Scholarship.” With a grant of $140,000, the fellowship enabled Westwood and six other journalists undertake a yearlong writing project focusing on free enterprise, American culture, and the democratic society.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=sarah-westwoods-salary-and-net-worth></span> <strong>Sarah Westwood’s </strong><strong>Salary and Net Worth</strong><br><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Although Sarah Westwood’s salary and net worth have not been shared or published on an official site, we’re aware that the average salary of a CNN correspondent dangles between $87,249 and $188,213, annually. There are still speculations that Westwood’s pay may be higher than average, considering her allocation to the White House.

But she is currently engaged to her fiancé, a political analyst by the name, Jon Conradi. Together, they have a son christened Christopher David Conradi. As of the time of writing, there has been no rumor concerning their wedding or a second child on the way. Westwood has tried to keep details of her personal life out of the media eye, however, fans have their fingers crossed, waiting for the slightest hint of another belly bump or some wedding bells ringing in the background.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=height-and-body-measurements></span><strong>Height and Body Measurements</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Sarah Westwood has an average build.

Nevertheless, she commands a substantial following on her social media handles, especially Twitter, where she has over 25,000 followers.</p><p>Her social media handles have been her major tool of giving fans a peek into her schedule and progress with her work. Westwood is among the world’s few who still have a fear of flying. Don’t say we told you! Sarah Westwood spends her weekends having fun times with family and friends. However, when extra duty calls, she works on weekends too.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaKuRp66pedaeqq2vn6Sxbq7IqGScmaKasrN5wJyfop2mmrqmutOsZKGto5eur7CMqKlmmp%2Bus7O1xKebaA%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fsarah-westwood-bio-career-achievements-husband-or-boyfriend.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fsarah-westwood-bio-career-achievements-husband-or-boyfriend.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fsarah-westwood-bio-career-achievements-husband-or-boyfriend.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fsarah-westwood-bio-career-achievements-husband-or-boyfriend.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fsarah-westwood-bio-career-achievements-husband-or-boyfriend.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fsarah-westwood-bio-career-achievements-husband-or-boyfriend.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./shivnarine-chanderpaul-retirement-wife.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./shivnarine-chanderpaul-retirement-wife.html>Shivnarine Chanderpaul retirement, wife, net worth, wife, age and more</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./pittsburgh-steelers-what-is-wrong-with-mitch-trubisky-hand-meet-his-mom-jeanne-trubisky-and-family-ethnicity.html>Pittsburgh Steelers: What Is Wrong With Mitch Trubisky Hand?
