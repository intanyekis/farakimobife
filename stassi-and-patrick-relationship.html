Their relationship was like a rollercoaster ride filled with ups and downs, twists, and turns. Let’s take a closer look at their journey together.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hnbgu.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Stassi-and-Patrick-Relationship-1-min-1024x580.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Who_Are_Stassi_and_Patrick></span><strong>Who Are Stassi and Patrick?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Stassi Schroeder, born on June 24, 1988, is a versatile American television personality, podcast host, fashion blogger, model, and author. She’s best known for her appearances on Vanderpump Rules, a popular Bravo reality show. Stassi grew up in New Orleans, Louisiana, and comes from a family of architects. She has two younger brothers, Hunter and Nikolai, and a younger sister named Georgianna. Stassi’s grandmother, Rosemary, held a special place in her heart, even though she passed away in May 2019.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hnbgu.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/126-Stassi-Schroeder-768x768-1.jpg><p>At the age of 11, Stassi started taking drama classes at Mount Carmel Academy, her high school. When she turned 18, she embarked on a journey to Hollywood and enrolled at Loyola Marymount University. She eventually earned a bachelor’s degree in English composition.</p><p>On the other side of the story, we have Patrick Meagher. Born on March 2, 1979, in Michigan, Patrick’s early life remains relatively private. Raised by his mother and two sisters after his parent’s separation, not much is known about his upbringing and education.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hnbgu.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Patrick-Meagher-1.png><p>Patrick’s career took off as a radio program host on Sirius Satellite XM radio, where he hosted a show called “Cocktails with Patrick.” The show gained popularity among radio listeners, leading to Patrick’s rise to fame. He later transitioned to Mad Dog Sports Radio, hosting “The Wrap” on Channel 85.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=The_Love_Story></span><strong>The Love Story</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hnbgu.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/patrick-meagher-3.jpg><p>Stassi and Patrick’s love story was far from ordinary. They had their fair share of highs and lows, and the world watched as their relationship unfolded on reality TV. Their four-year anniversary in August would turn out to be a pivotal moment.</p><p>It was on this special day, their anniversary, that Patrick decided to end things. The timing couldn’t have been worse. Stassi was all set for a romantic getaway to Mexico with him when the unexpected happened. The breakup came out of nowhere, leaving Stassi in shock.</p><p>According to Stassi herself, their relationship had always been a bit rocky, marked by breakups and makeup. But this time, it felt different. It was a genuine separation, and it hit Stassi hard.</p><p>Over the next few months, she went through a challenging period as she tried to move on from the breakup. Despite the pain, Stassi didn’t cut ties with Patrick completely. She still spoke to him and even referred to him as a “wonderful person.” However, she made it clear that they wouldn’t be rekindling their romance.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Moving_On></span><strong>Moving On</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>As Stassi reentered the dating scene, she found solace in her newfound freedom. She embraced the single life and didn’t rush into anything new. Fortunately for her, she didn’t have any disastrous dates to report. It seemed like she was content with her solo adventures.</p><p>Many fans had hoped for something more between Stassi and her friend, Shep Rose, who also appeared on Bravo reality TV shows. However, Stassi set the record straight, stating that they were just good friends. She had high praise for Shep, describing him as “attractive, charming, and clever.” But she added a humorous twist, saying, “However, we would probably murder one another.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=In_Conclusion></span><strong>In Conclusion</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Stassi and Patrick’s relationship was a whirlwind of emotions. They went through their share of breakups and reconciliations before finally parting ways for good. While their love story had its fair share of drama, it’s clear that both Stassi and Patrick have moved on to different chapters in their lives.</p><p>For Stassi, the single life brought a sense of freedom and self-discovery. She was in no hurry to jump into a new relationship and enjoyed her own company. As for Patrick, his career in radio continued to thrive.</p><p>Sometimes, love stories don’t have fairy tale endings, and that’s okay. Stassi and Patrick’s journey reminds us that relationships can be complex, but they also teach us valuable lessons about growth and self-discovery.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=FAQ></span><strong>FAQ</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><h3 class=rank-math-question><span class=ez-toc-section id=How_long_were_Stassi_and_Patrick_together></span><strong>How long were Stassi and Patrick together?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Stassi and Patrick were together for about four years before they broke up on their four-year anniversary in August.</p><h3 class=rank-math-question><span class=ez-toc-section id=Are_Stassi_and_Patrick_together></span><strong>Are Stassi and Patrick together?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Stassi and Patrick are not together.
